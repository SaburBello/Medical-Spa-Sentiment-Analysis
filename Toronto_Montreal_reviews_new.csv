All thanks to Chyanne. She is such a kind person explained everything to me. She listened to all my issues I was facing for my skin and recommended me the two treatments and asked me to choose the one fit my budget, which I truly appreciate because not many businesses ask or give privilege to choose according to customer budget. My skin felt amazing after the session. Chyanne knowledge and advices have also greatly helped me improve my skincare routine. Already booked for my next appointment. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.

I had a thorough skincare routine and used prescription topicals for a few months and nothing seemed to be working for me. When i started going to Devon she recommended a skincare routine and products that are much simpler and more hydrating. She great at explaining the different steps of the facial and the proper aftercare/what to expect from your skin. I had my fourth appointment today and my skin is so much less congested and i hardly get cystic acne anymore. Devon is amazing at what she does and KNOWS what your skin needs. A++++

I came a few times to New Age Spa but this was my first time with her. Let me tell you, this girl is the absolute sweetest. She is so patient, understanding and knowledgeable. She started the treatment and right before doing the chemical peel, it turns out that one of the product needed ran out of stock and the delivery did not happen on time. Chyanne offered me 2 solutions: either do a lighter chemical peel or rebook my appointment. I decided to rebook my appointment, but she still went on with taking care of my face and applying vitamin C serum and hydrating cream, making me feel all pampered. At the end, she also offered me a sample. In the end, I had a cleaning/hydrating session and a sample and was able to quickly rebook my appointment.

I had purchased a Black Friday voucher for an Anti-Acne Facial Peel and made an appointment for the same. During the consultation, the aesthetician told me that it would be better to do a facial instead of the peel. She confirmed that the voucher I purchased was interchangeable for this service, and that there would not be a remaining balance to pay. Upon checkout, the receptionist told me that it doesn't work that way, and I would need to pay the difference.
I paid the balance and left but the situation was not sitting well with me. I reached out to the spa directly via email to try to resolve the situation. They replied that I should not have trusted what was said to me during the consultation, and that I should have read the FAQs. I'm very disappointed with their response and feel like I was blindsided. I understand that the aesthetician may have made a mistake, but at the very least I would have expected an apology, instead of the response I received.
I really loved this spa and now I feel like I can't go back.",,

I went in for a facial with Devon, for a consult and micro needling. On the website it says they use B3 but instead she used this cheap low quality hyaluronic acid with bad Amazon reviews. I should‚Äôve walked out there but I trusted in the specialist right? To be clear I had perfect skin, never had acne issues growing up or dark spots, I just wanted to try the treatment to see what the hype was about. Well it turns out to be the biggest regret of my life, as when she did my facial she went over the same spot multiple times, bruised my face to filth! Felt like a tattoo. Even then I had high hopes, I was thinking she was a professional and surely knew what she was doing. WRONG! Trust your gut people, days past and I started getting break outs for the first time ever in my life, almost like a bacterial rash on the skin, weeks followed and more and more painful pimples. Once clear skin turns filled with dark spots, and management says I need to trust the ‚Äúprocess‚Äù and come back for more. How absolutely delusional, I had no issues with my skin and after Devon wrecks my face you‚Äôre saying another round will fix the problem ? They pay people to leave 5 star reviews and even had the audacity to email me the same offer. So never come here and if you do never see Devon !! I attached before the treatment and after 1.5 months of ‚Äúwaiting for it to heal‚Äù . She probably just messed up my skin on purpose so I can keep coming back to fix the problem. Evil !

Edit: since they responded to the review saying this can happen with ‚Äúacne prone skin‚Äù. Let me clarify that I‚Äôve never had acne in my life as I stated before. So if I‚Äôm having acne after the facial it is clearly acute (caused by the facial only) as for after care, it‚Äôs disappointing they‚Äôd try to say I didn‚Äôt follow the instructions to relive Devon of blame. Yes I followed every instruction, why wouldn‚Äôt I? Stop making excuses for your malpractice. As I said in the caption the circular things on my face are pimple patches, the photos are not fake. Take accountability for the damage you‚Äôve cause instead of blaming a client, a victim of your malpractice. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the before and after photos on their website are showing the before pictures as the after, and really the after is the image they list as before.",1,"Thank you for sharing your feedback, although we're sorry to hear that your experience didn‚Äôt meet your expectations.

However several issues need to be stated which I attempted to resolve with them privately: 1) incessant text messages with forms to fill and texts, and calls multiple times per day which are very disruptive to people who work during the day. Clients should just have to fill out the form once and this form can apply to all appointments (as do all other spas) and clients should be able to opt-out out of receiving texts without needing to block the number and maintain ability to communicate with the spa. When I raised this issue with the receptionist she said there was no way to opt out of texts and that I had to block the number, but then I would not be able to communicate with the spa, in 2024 this really makes no sence. 2) arrived late one time (15-20 mins) and they were unable to accommodate me, however, once they were late and I just had to deal with it (which is OK, it happens, but then should be able to accommodate clients and 3) very expensive facial with gloves, i usually get facials at least 1/month and I've never had a facial with gloves and it was not enjoyable and when I asked the technician to remove gloves she said it was the policy. All this to say, would expect much better attention to client satisfaction in a business that is supposed to be centred on the client and with this many 5 star reviews. I've gone 4 times for laser and once for a facial, but now because of these issues I will find another place  to finish my laser and would not recommend this place.",,

Called to make an appointment, booked me in for 1:30 pm the next day and said, they would send a text to confirm the appointment. Never received the text. Called next day for confirmation of appointment and was told it doesn't exist. Unprofessional place and suggest not to go here or waste your time booking appointments.

Edit: I don't think the owners understand what I mentioned in the review. This is the response to the owners. The booking system NEVER AUTOMATICALLY sent me anything. I did not receive any form to complete. If you do not provide body care to MEN, then MENTION that on the first call and not confirm and tell me a form will be sent.

If they had read the review properly maybe they could look into the booking system but attention to detail is missing. Audacity to reply back rudely.

Honesty is lacking, I usually spend thousands of dollars on body care and will be taking my business somewhere else. I am relieved I never spend a dime here.

Today I was scheduled for a facial but woke up terribly sick. To not endanger the team at the spa, I tried to reach out and postpone the appointment.
Their email does not work. They did not pick up the phone after 3 (!!) calls. The voice message I left was explicitly explaining the unfortunate reason of having to postpone to the next week.
I asked for understanding. I also was hoping they will not charge the cancellation fee. However, in the end, nobody called me back, nobody helped me to reschedule and I was charged $50.
Not going there again. Do not recommend.

EDIT: Evidence of the $50 charge attached.
For clarity, the review was initially posted in November 2023. Interestingly, the owner did not respond at that time, likely due to a lack of explanation for the situation.

The receptionist is always friendly, the rooms very clean and the new location near Charlevoix metro station is lovely. I once had to wait half an hour extra for my appointment and the receptionist could tell that I was very anxious because I had another appointment afterwards.

The treatment doesn't hurt, but afterwards it's unpleasant. I was pressure-sold for products. It was really very insistent. She didn't tell me how to use them.

I want to clarify that I would never leave a comment about a place without a valid experience. My reviews‚Äîwhether 1, 2, 4, or 5 stars‚Äîare always based on my actual experiences and reflect the service I received.

Regarding your establishment, my experience was disappointing. Your team appeared unprofessional, with members handling everything from massages to hair treatments and operating machines without the proper qualifications. This lack of specialization raises concerns about the quality and safety of the services provided.

And yes, maybe‚Äîlike most people‚ÄîI tend to share negative experiences more often than positive ones. However, I encourage you to take a closer look at the reviews your place has received. The majority are 1 or 2 stars, so perhaps instead of blaming me, it would be more productive to focus on addressing the recurring issues raised by multiple clients.",1,"We checked you didn't come.

that is where i had the best customer service on the phone by Djazia who was so nice and professional as well very informative
so i decided to go there and see by myself the type of service they have and not listen too much to those one star reviews because most of them seems similar and i now think that they are fake
merci once arrived i was welcomed with a nice smile by the beautiful personnel working there
i had an amazing hammam experience thanks to mrs Aicha who was incredibly nice and gave me a deep refreshing scrub
i followed that by a massage from mouna the massage was so relaxing to the point i wanted to sleep
i was also intrested by their weight loss program and at the end the nutritioniste dr gave me all needed info on that
the personnel offered me free cookies with morrocan tea that was so appreciated
the place was clean beautiful decor it wasn‚Äôt crowdy because they‚Äôre organized and clients need appointments to go there
kind personnel relaxing music with spa them
i highly recommend highly
that was my first time to visit certainly not the last",6,Thank you for your review.We look forward to seeing you again soon. We would appreciate to actually change your review score in order to correctly reflect your experience. √Ä bient√¥t

The visit exceeded all expectations.

Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted at Zenabelle with a seamless blend of cordiality and professionalism, establishing a delightful tone for my visit. The exemplary customer service extended by each staff member demonstrated a sincere dedication not only to my comfort but also to ensuring my complete satisfaction. Their attentive and amiable demeanor created an atmosphere of genuine hospitality.

The ambiance at Zenabelle was truly exceptional‚Äîa serene and tranquil environment that fostered deep relaxation. The meticulously maintained facilities and meticulous attention to detail contributed significantly to an indulgent spa experience.

Drawing from my extensive background as a master coach specializing in customer service since 2010, I maintain discerning standards. Zenabelle unequivocally surpassed these benchmarks, deserving a definitive 5-star rating for their steadfast commitment to excellence and customer-centric approach.

It is crucial to emphasize that this review remains uninfluenced by any form of remuneration or incentive. My decision to enthusiastically endorse Zenabelle on my influential social media platforms (including TikTok and Instagram) stems purely from a genuine appreciation for the exceptional service and memorable experience they provided.

Furthermore, as a businessman, I believe Zenabelle Clinique de Naturopathie holds significant growth potential in the future. With the market not yet saturated, scaling the business could capitalize on ample opportunities.

I wholeheartedly recommend Zenabelle Clinique de Naturopathie for an enriching and superior spa retreat. Aziz. M",1,

First thing that was disappointing was the fact that there was no shower gel or soap in the shower or even at the sink.
The distance between the Hemam area and the massage area was quite a walk specially that you are not dressed and walking around with a towel on.
However, the worst part was the massage therapist, and as a result the massage experience.

The lady was dressed in suit like outfit with shoes with a bit of a heel which made clicking sound the whole time.

she was unprofessional in every sense.
The light was bright, she was holding a vapor and coffee, she was loud there was no way  you relax never mind enjoy the experience l.
Instead of having a calm relaxing music she was playing music directly from her phone, and the massage was inturpted several times as she kept going to her phone to skip the commercials on YouTube.
She also kept going in and out several times after 12 min from a 45 min massage I asked to stop as I was unable to sit through such horrible service.

The worst experience ever, I rarely ever write a review but I couldn‚Äôt help myself not to as I left more stressed than I arrived. This was supposed be a relaxing day after two weeks of back to back work however I wish I never even bothered.

I had booked a massage with a specific massage therapist, but once there, I was assigned another person without even informing me. When I made the comment, the staff ignored my request and acted as if nothing had happened.

In addition, the massage room was cluttered with unnecessary items (chair, extra bed, etc.), which detracted from the relaxing atmosphere that one expects in this type of place.

When I returned home, I discovered that the insurance receipt contained incorrect information: the number of sessions, the amount paid, and even the name of the massage therapist did not match.

When calling to correct the receipt, the owner instead proceeded to tell a series of unnecessary stories, including that she had ‚Äúgiven a warning‚Äù to an employee, simply because I had left a two-star review. Honestly, the internal organization of the clinic does not concern me: I am a client who has paid for a service, and I expect this service to be up to par.

Fortunately, with the other professionals who took care of me afterwards, I was treated very well.

It was a joy to have been scrubbed by Nadia in the hammam. She is attentive and efficient. Fabulous experience!

Youssera, at the massage, has fairy fingers! She really listens to the small and large tensions to be released in the muscles!

I really recommend!

Also, here is what I would have liked someone to tell me for my very first visit to a hammam... You have to see the hammam as a place to wash yourself: to sweat thoroughly in a steam bath to get rub the body to remove dead peaces. Afterwards, we soap ourselves and shower. You can then take the opportunity to wash your hair, apply a hair treatment, or make a moisturizing facial mask. In short, you have 1:30 to pamper yourself.

Bring: padlock for the locker, swimsuit or spare panties for the public hammam (you can be topless if you are comfortable), your body soap, shampoo and conditioner, washcloth, moisturizing mask or facial scrub if you feel like it!  my. Don't forget your pool sandals.

I will definitely go back!",,"Good morning

Regulations that have no logic, simply so that we can pay for a blow-dry.

Letting people do a Hammam, a scrub, a massage go out with wet hair is no thanks.

the person who takes the reservation with the security deposit from your card risks stealing money from you a few days later.

I realize 4 days later that 3 transactions have been made on my card for a total of 360 dollars for the ETSY online sales site.

It‚Äôs been for Botox injections for medical reasons. The injections themselves were fine, and helpful, but at my last visit in October, I asked if he would be able to fill out some forms for my private insurance to request further coverage. I had previously asked his receptionist about this and she said it should be ok. I also asked about cost, because I know there‚Äôs usually a charge, which I would‚Äôve been ok with.

Anyway, I brought the forms in, with imaging reports, a list of previous treatments, the dates, and their efficacy. When I asked Dr. Nikolis if he would fill them out he answered weirdly defensively saying he couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo them today!‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt expected that. Then after some more uncomfortable discussion he said to me something along the lines of ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt usually bring papers for insurance to a place like this.‚Äù That was really condescending and snobby.

I would understand if there was some policy about this, but I wasn‚Äôt able to find one, and I was never given a clear answer. I did leave the forms with his receptionist. I haven‚Äôt received anything from my insurance company, and I haven‚Äôt heard back from the receptionist after following up almost two weeks ago.

I had trusted her expertise and chosen her for a cosmetic eye surgery, even following and supporting her practice on Instagram. However, my recent interaction has been nothing short of disheartening.

Out of desperation, I reached out to her for guidance regarding a rare and painful shingles case around my eye area. I sent detailed pictures and explained my condition when booking a consultation through her office. Despite this, when I arrived for my appointment, I was treated poorly.  The doctor refused to check my eyes and showed no empathy for my situation.

This experience left me feeling worse than when I walked in. If this was a case they couldn‚Äôt assist with, they could have easily informed me beforehand instead of stringing me along and wasting my time. Now, I‚Äôm forced to start over and find another ophthalmologist

I've been growing a 2nd head on my back for over 10 years aka a huge subcutaneous cyst. Not dire but unsightly, tender and impossible to reach on my own.

Dr. Bernstein took one look and suggested excision on the spot. Fifteen minutes later it was done and for a price so reasonable it was shocking. SO glad my BF recommended going private.

I could cry for joy and relief. I will definitely be back for other removals. Thank you so much, Dr. Bernstein.

She described the cyst precisely on size and looks.

I was greeted and immediately reassured by the dr's assistant it was only esthetic and not dangerous (that's the consultation) and they offered to remove it immediately.

As for the operation itself, it was $810, a complete different ballpark than what my wife was told. I wouldn't be complaining if my cyst was a golf ball size or if it was $100 more but we are talking over $1,100 with taxes, nowhere near expected amount. One of the person there told me the staff is trained only to say pricing starts at $X on phone and they didnt want to see a photo before, no wonder why.

A hugely disappointing experience. Clearly they are banking on your emotive side once you're inside.",3,"We are sorry to hear of your disappointment M. Pelletier.

The issue I am now having is purely administrative. I paid in advance for a treatment that I have had many times successfully at this location. When I arrived the technician said she didn't think that treatment was appropriate for me. I was very surprised but I trust her judgment. We had a quick conversation and parlayed the money I had already paid into an appointment for another (unrelated) treatment. At that time I told her I had issues with psoriasis in the area in question. She assured me it wouldn't be a problem. When I got home I read the website and it states that people with psoriasis should not get this treatment. I then visited my dermatologist and she advised against it. I cancelled the appointment weeks in advance. Everyone was polite there were no issues to till this point. When I cancelled my appointment the girl on the phone took my credit card number for a refund. I waited a few weeks but no refund. I called the office and say said they didn't do refunds on the credit card and instead would send me a cheque, a miscommunication but fine. I was told that my case was a bit complicated, for an administrative reason I don't quite understand, and that the operations manager would have to take care of it. I spoke with her and she said there would be a cheque waiting the next time I came into the office, planned for a week later. I arrived...no cheque. Caitlin called accounting and said that that cheque had not even be written yet. We are now at over three weeks from the time I cancelled the appointment. She assured me it would be sent at the end of the week and I would receive an email letting me know. She told me that I am not the only one who is having issues, everyone waiting for a refund is having issues. I don't find this particularly comforting. She was pleasant but I could tell I was irritating her. Yes, I have called a number of times to get an update on what is going on but this is over 1k I'm waiting for and each time I am given a date the date passes with no explanation. The end of the week comes and goes and no news. At the beginning of this week I called and left a message and I sent an email asking simply that they respond to me in writing to let me know the total amount and when I can reasonably expect the refund to be sent. Literally, no response. I certainly understand there is only so much Caitlin can do and she is not personally responsible for sending out refunds. I really don't like having to call repeatedly and make a nuisance of myself. It has now been almost 6 weeks since I requested a refund. I am unsure of where to go from here and the lack of accurate information is unsettling. It would be great if someone could get back to me, preferably in writing, with an accurate update. Again, I am not laying blame on any particular person. This is one of those unfortunate administrative hiccups that happen, we merely need to find a solution in a timely manner and communicate it effectively.",10,"Hello Amanda.

My treatment was with Lisa, and she instantly made me feel comfortable and was very honest with me about what she recommended. She never made me feel like she was trying to sell unnecessary products or add on extra services like other places I've been to. She explained what she was doing every step of the way to make sure I was comfortable and answered all my questions with ease.

I received service on August 6 and September 18, the BELA. I am now writing for August 6, because I gave the chance a second time on September 18 and believing that I was going to have another technician because I had asked the receptionist. Brief.
Extremely dissatisfied with the dragging received by the technician who spent half the time outside the room (both dates). Concerning September 18, I arrived at 12:55 p.m., my appointment is at 1:00 p.m. The technician arrives at 1:05 p.m. to pick me up. We begin the treatment, with the machine, with the 3 or 4 steps (fairly quick). No extraction done by the technician, when I know very well that I have a lot to do. The first time she did it but it was quite light. During these treatments, there is red light and a mask. During these two stages, she leaves you alone in the room, which is completely unhygienic, walks in and out, touches the door handles and probably makes other stains outside, which disgusts me greatly, because it It‚Äôs still my face that people touch. I travel across the
world and receives the most refined treatments in beautiful aesthetic centers, you are never left alone in the room. That said, the treatment on September 18 ends at 1:50 p.m....and on August 6, it lasted 60 minutes, it's only because she left me almost 15-20 minutes with the mask alone in the room, so If you calculate correctly, it's about 45 minutes of treatment for $260 and what's more, we dare ask you for a tip. I'm quite shy at these times, so I still gave an amount of money. I left disgusted and frustrated. I have been a customer since the very beginning of your center, I have spent thousands, and I have never been so dissatisfied with these last two services that I received. I obviously had to go back to a beautician to redo the work.",,"Hello Ms. Gareau,

Great receptionist service. As for the laser treatment it was ok...however when it came time to pay, I had quite a surprise!! First, I was told that they took prepaid Visa gift cards: after trying the card several times, it never worked. I knew that the clinic reserves an extra $38 if you pay in part with a prepaid card and no one knew about it!!
Then, the technician who seemed impatient, clearly told me that I had to leave a tip!!!????? Yet they are not paid with a tipped salary so why demand it? (for a 25 min treatment... at $500 + 15% tip) we agree that it's completely ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!! I spend several dollars for other treatments in Laval and NEVER have anyone asked for a tip and I even asked other clients and they all told me that they never even thought it was necessary .. imagine a tip on a botox treatment ect.. 2000$ + 15% ü§®.

I joined Victoria Park because my dermatologist for 19 years and my sister for 15 years, Dr. Madeleine Gagnon, has become indispensable to us in our lives. Dr. Gagnon is so professional. Our file is always updated the day before our appointment. Its objective is to look natural, taking into account our face. She won't do anything that doesn't suit us, there's no point in insisting. In complete safety, I have been seeing her at least every 6 months for 19 years. No problem.  Still excited by the result. Dr Gagnon is a painter, his eye is skilled at improving, highlighting our features and making us beautiful!  Despite depressed periods in my life, she always knew how to cheer me up.  It's impossible to do without her! She is constantly improving! The service is so personalized, its employees so exceptional that I couldn't believe you have employees of this high level!

Well yes, M√©lanie Cloutier is extraordinary. She embodies the personalized service that my sister Sylvie and I love so much.

With complete confidence we left our faces in his skillful hands. I had a Halo treatment on October 2 and I'm going back to see her for a second one on January 3, 2020! Same thing for my sister.

I congratulate Victoria Park human resources for finding this gem!!!

We serve happy customers until the end. Indeed, finishing beautiful is our retirement goal!
And we hope to live a very long time and not look our age!
Please forward the message to your clinic in Laval

Sincerely,

Jocelyne and Sylvie Lussier

Only reason why it is a 4 star is that I was shocked (quite literally), by part of the facial. I booked a classic facial and the description is quite vague and it has been about 6 years since I have had a facial so I understand that things change and new practices emerge, but I wish I was informed about a treatment I can only really described as being shocked with electricity. It was so painful, it hurt the nerves in my teeth and later in the day it hurt to even brush them. It also gave me a massive headache. I think if this had been mentioned in the website description I would have not booked this type. Perhaps this is super common with a facial? Like I said it has been several years since my last one so maybe this is an expected treatment. I was just very taken aback by it.",,Thank you for visiting us and sharing your experience.

After expressing my concerns about the inconvenience caused by their machine issues, Shannon mentioned the possibility of legal action in response to my review. Shannon also updated her response to my initial review to claim she had tried to reschedule my appointment due to the machine incident, but this is not accurate. I was only informed about rescheduling when I was already at the clinic, with the option to wait until a new machine arrived‚Äîsomething that would disrupt my treatment schedule.

No alternative was offered to address how this situation impacted my treatment plan. I found this response disappointing. I encourage anyone considering this clinic to take my experience into account. I stand by my review and will await any further actions from the clinic.

-------------------

I had a poor experience at this clinic. My laser hair removal appointments were rescheduled multiple times; I was understanding for the first two changes, but the third reschedule was pushed out two weeks due to a broken machine. I wasn‚Äôt informed in advance, and the session was canceled only after I arrived at the clinic, even though they knew the machine wasn‚Äôt working. I was concerned about delayed results from missing a session during the correct Anagen phase, but I received no assurance on how this delay might impact my outcome, nor any resolution for the inconvenience.

Additionally, I noticed they offer incentives for positive reviews, which may impact the balance of feedback on this clinic. Given my experience, I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend this clinic.",5,"We would like to address some inaccuracies.

By your logic, no diabetic patient would ever go to the dermatologist. I've already been to multiple places and Drs knew what they were doing. You should mention in your website ""we don't have experience with diabetic patients"" and save people's time instead of using pathetic excuses and asking for your ignorance and lack of experience to be appreciated.",1,

First impressions was really bad since they accused me of going 2 hrs early while I was on time and I arrived 15 min before my appointment. They did this since the main esthetician that i booked with was with a client and they wanted to trick me and say even though you didn't come on time we are accommodating you!!! I mean seriously??? Don't do that on clients when I have written email confirmation with date, time and name of the staff I booked with.
The entire session was only 30 minutes! Please beware of that because it's not mentioned on their website. Usually all facials that I received at other locations are at least 1 hour long and they do multiple steps of opening your pores, cleansing, extraction and applying 2-3 serums and masks plus an SPF Sunscreen at the end so as a result once you come out of the salon your skin feels soft and you would be glowing for the next few days!  Also, the salon does not have a relaxing vibe. No music and no privacy as the other personnel would pop their head from time to time.  There is also a lack of focused light and magnifying glass to look at your skin more closely. Therefore, the extractions were not done properly. Again comparing to other places this would be a waste of time, energy and money. Fancy places like Spas in Old port do a complete facial in 1 hour for the same price in a more relaxing and professional environment with better products.",2,"Dear Yas,

I saw Shanon for my first microblading procedure and I‚Äôm very pleased with my experience. She is meticulous, professional and dedicated.

I had a lipblush done by Shannon in April, she gave me great advice on color, if I had chosen it myself it wouldn't be as beautiful and I love the very natural result. As I'm over 60 and my goal was above all better definition, I was a little afraid of the ""contour line"" effect but it's not the case, it's just perfect. Shannon explains well, is truly a perfectionist and passionate about what she does. So I enjoyed my experience so much that I went back yesterday for microblading of my eyebrows. I'm blonde, my eyebrows are almost invisible and I wanted a natural effect. Wow... to think I hesitated for so long.

Laser technician  , Mariya , made me feel extremely comfortable throughout the whole process. She is super duper nice and very attentive on the progress of your sessions and how you should treat your skin after the treatment and as a side note , she is also a Skin Care Routine Expert !!! She recommended a few products that literally changed my skin to something that I have not witnessed before. I had ingrown hair issues with hyperpigmentation and her advice on products was very much on point.

Dermamode also had the most latest technology for Laser Hair Removal , which was helpful in order to get rid of my hair regardless of how much naturally dark-skinned and at occasions tanned after the summer sun exposure I was.

I would be hopefully reaching the target 80% removal soon.

Would recommend it 100% both for Price and Efficacy !!!! ü§©ü§©

I‚Äôm bravely speaking out to warn everyone: don‚Äôt be deceived and waste a large amount of money in this clinique.
I spent at least $20,000 at their clinic and tried treatment she recommended 3-5 times , with some treatments done up 10 times. Each time, there was no effect at all.  I always believed what she said, deceiving myself with hope and illusions for the next treatment. All the Five-start reviews here are fake, and she knows it!!
I was a loyal customer of this clinic for over two years and underwent treatments for acne scars and pigmentation removal there. Initially, I only had a few acne scars, but after several treatments (once every 1-2 months, totaling 5-10 sessions), my skin ended up with over 50 pits. As for pigmentation removal, after 5-10 sessions, there was no lightening or improvement whatsoever.

That‚Äôs why I wrote this letter to them, and below is the response I received from their clinic a few days later. For privacy reasons, I do not want to share my photos. Every time she saw me, she could clearly see the uneven, scarred condition of my face. Yet now, after everything, they have the audacity to demand I send them my private photos. Their behavior is truly overbearing and excessive, showing absolutely no respect for ethics or legal boundaries.",3,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Otherwise, my experience would warrant just 1 star.

After more than 4 years of loyalty‚Äîvisiting at least once a month‚ÄîI‚Äôm extremely disappointed with how the establishment handled 2 involuntary no-shows. Despite calling both times to explain last-minute emergencies and offering to pay the missed appointment fees at my next visit. I was met with a rigid ‚Äúnew mandatory policy.‚Äù They claimed that the system wouldn‚Äôt allow them to book an appointment without a credit card on file (which I‚Äôm not really comfortable giving) or prepayment (which is absurd). However, the receptionist had already booked my appointment, and I even received the system‚Äôs booking confirmation, proving this isn‚Äôt a technical necessity and contradicts their claim (as proven in picture below).

Over the years, I‚Äôve purchased several of their recommended products‚Äînone of which worked as promised‚Äîand never once complained. I remained incredibly patient, willing to continue treatments despite limited results because I truly had faith in their services. I‚Äôve spent a significant amount of money at their establishment, doing full-body laser hair removal‚Äînot just one body part‚Äîalong with facials and even hormonal testing. I wasn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúcheapen out‚Äù; I invested heavily in their services and trusted their recommendations, even as I continued to experience hair growth after OVER 18 laser sessions.

It‚Äôs disheartening to realize that after all this time, loyalty, and significant financial investment, the business prioritizes profits over building trust and relationships with long-term clients.

It seems like they are more interested in selling products over providing actual, quality services. At the consultation, I was told the skincare line they carried would be beneficial for me, but it was nothing special. I fell into the trap, and as soon as I started buying a few products, the aesthetician kept recommending me to buy more and more if I wanted to see optimal results. I don't blame her as maybe that's how they make money, but it's not the best model for a clinic. I ended up staying with them for a few sessions, and although I did see some results, it was not from their skincare line but from the services.

The Place is clean and the personal is kind. However, i am really disapointed because I paid multiple sessions for electrolysis for nothing.

I had a discussion with the  manager and was supposed to receive an email but never had a follow up regarding this issue.

You fill in a medical check and the first time I was feeling a bit under the weather she offered me to reschedule to make sure I would take the treatment well. She is so professional & lovely, with precise, gentle gestures you know you're in good hands. The procedure took around 2hrs total because I'm sensitive and asked for extra numbing cream which is no issue. I got swollen, bled a little and small bruising but it is normal and all gone in 24hrs after when you can wash your face. The first time I didn't see much result but still felt good so I came back for a second (4 is recommended to start, then one every few months), and I got a perfectly smoothed forehead right away, as if I had done Botox. I think it'll be good for my dark circles even if they can't completely go away, it's basically risk free procedure. This is the area where I couldn't even feel the needle so if youre scared when getting close to the eyes like I was don't worry, it's my crows' feet I felt more (but still entirely bearable).

If you're reading this and are hesitating to get laser hair removal, this is your sign to go for it!! You won't regret it! Before going to Dermamode, I had 7 sessions (fully body) at another reputable clinic in Ottawa, and after moving back to Montreal, I needed to find another clinic to pursue my treatments. I went for Dermamode feeling skeptical (which you should be, as there are lots of terrible laser clinics), but I'm now on my 3rd or 4th treatment at Dermamode and I just wish I cam here sooner! I'm seeing significantly better results!! On the downside, it's a lot more painful than I experienced in the other clinic, but that's probably because I wasn't getting the proper treatment for my very dark and coarse hair.
Mariya is so lovely! She's patient, professional and motherly! She goes at my pace, she explains everything before doing anything, and answers all my questions. I have literally zero complaints.

I booked my consultation with Audrey at Dermamode and was pleasantly surprised that she was able to offer an alternative solution that she believed would be more effective and less expensive than laser to get rid of those last few stubborn hairs left from the previous treatments. The amazing thing is that she could have easily chose to make a larger sale and continue laser treatments on me but was actually so honest and professional that she recommended what was best for me, the customer :) I'd previously had electrolysis done in other areas of my body so was already aware of how amazing the results can be but had never thought to complete the hair removal on my face with this..the last few years I've had multiple treatments on my face from IPL, waxing, threading, bleaching and even shaving! I've had a good few treatments with Audrey over the last few months and I'm very happy to say my traumatic hairy face ordeal is almost over! And not only has the treatment been successful, but all the staff are super friendly and professional, the environment is clean and they have electrolysis packages to allow you to save money if you're looking for multiple treatments over time.

The technician I had was really nice and super sweet (can't remember her name) which is the only reason I am giving two stars instead of one, and I went for numerous treatments here which ended up leaving 2 pretty noticeable dented hole marks on my face. I was told it was going to go away within a couple months when I first saw the first one and was very concerned, but it never did, and a few treatments later a second permanent scar was made in my skin by the needle. A dermatologist I went to inquiring about how to fix that said we could try fillers, but it wouldn't fully do anything really and that there was no real way to do undo this as it is a permanent scarring, which is pretty upsetting. He also said ""how big was the needle they used?!' Apparently that is not a common thing to happen I guess. I have wanted to continue treatments ever since but have stopped going after the technician scarred me that second time and the last one still wasn't diminishing as I was told it would, and years later they are as noticeable as the first day she made them. I'm not sure if she was trying to lie about the fact they would be permanent scars or if she really didn't know and assumed they would go away on their own but I'm at last glad I stopped going to her for treatments for that reason. So at least I only have two scar holes on my face instead of more but it is something that has bothered me alot and why I have been afraid to continue with electrolysis. I also have blonde hair so laser wouldn't work for me and IPL never worked when I tried it elsewhere 10 years ago either. Not sure what to do about this but to say it has been a disappointing experience would be an understatement. Wish I could say I had the great results and experience everyone else seemed to have here as the great reviews was the reason I picked this place to go to in the first place.",1,"Good afternoon,

On the other hand, for the permanent laser hair removal service, I am personally very disappointed with the results. During my telephone consultation session the lady sold me a bit of the dream on effectiveness by sharing her experience and how she could ‚Äúcount on one hand the hair she had after 6 sessions‚Äù and how to charge a little more may be worth it.

She told me that the price will be $500 for 1 session and it will take 2 or 3. She assured me that I will receive more information the next day by email or they will call me. She took pictures of my back too. Also she tried to sell me a product for buttons for $100 but I don't even have any buttons, she herself told me that at the beginningü§£After a week of silence I decided to call then I only managed to get 4 times. The lady who answered had no information about me and then she started giving her own prices. She didn't even see any photos or anything like she told me but now it's become 750 and it takes 4 sessions. It seemed like she wanted to negotiate with me since we were at the bazaar ü§£. Afterwards she told me we can reduce a quantity of session but I will double the price for one in this case. To summarize, I'm just going to say that it's really not their business. 1 technician says one thing while trying to sell you a product which even says that I don't need it. After the other tried to negotiate the price and there is no pricelist. As I work in sales I had plenty of experience with rubbish salespeople and I'm sure that's the case. I don't advise wasting your time on them.",6,"Dear Customer,

1636,Clinique Corps Id√©al - Ideal Body Clinic - Monkland,Skin care clinic,1 star,1,344,"6000 Monkland Ave, Montreal, Quebec H4A 1G8",Jediael Zongo,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110484865040651005499/reviews?hl=en,a month ago,"Don't ever pay for their lipolaser or any other body contouring treatment at this clinic. They are all scams and they don't yield any result, not even imaginary ones. Sadly I can't give 0 stars so they get to have that one. Worst place ever. I paid to have 5 sessions at 469,50$ and only did 2 of them. When I said that I was unsatisfied with the results and wanted a refund for the 3 sessions I did not take yet, they told me they don't give refund and that I could have store credits or other products. Then I said I wasn't interested in anything else. At first, they stopped replying to my emails for one week hoping that I would just go away. But I called and persisted, even thought the manager did everything to avoid me and always used clueless employees as shield. And there is no number nor email to contact the manager at all. Finally they came up with an offer: they would charge me plain price for the 2 sessions I took because the offer of 5 sessions was at a promotional price when I paid and they would substract it from the 469,50$ I paid initially and that 1 session at plain price was 180+taxes so the 2 would be 360+taxes and I would only be refunded 49$. With that logic it means that if I took 3 on the 5 sessions I paid for instead and asked for a refund I would be the one owing them money for being dissatisfied. Of course I asked them what kind of logic was that and I said that if I paid at promotional price I wanted a refund at promotional price. And then they recontacted me saying that they negociated a better arrangement. They said that they could only refund me for 2 session's price instead of the 3 on 5 sessions I did not take yet, the reason being that since I want a refund, the price of 1 session would be used as my ""processing fees"". Some more nonsense just to not give me my money üòÇ but at that point I was fed up and accepted. And I also forgot I signed a contract with them that said ""no refund"" on it so I did not want to argue. But that no refund contract is assuming that the treatments hold any type of value and are not total scams that do not work as advertised right? So in the end, I would have settled for a 181$ refund until they sent me a refund contract with a clause of non denigration in which I would have to never talk about them  whether it's online or in real life and never tell anyone about my experience with them to protect their reputation üòÇ. I told them I would only sign that contract for a full refund not for a measly 100$ and they told me they were offering me this partial refund of 181$ and keeping the 90$ of the 3rd session because of ""processing fees"" as a token of good faith and that anyways I signed a no refund contract and they don't owe me anything even thought when I signed I did not know it was a scam. They would do anything to keep every dollar possible from lying to inventing inexisting ""processing fees"" and illogical new rules. Once you swipe your card for a payment there, your money is lost forever. I would never recommend this place for anything. They only show their true face to you when they already took your money and know you are never coming back. For example I could never get in touch with the ""manager"" or whoever rules there for days even though they promised me I would receive a call later everytime because he/she was ""busy"" with clients. When I told them that I've been a client for months since I paid too and as such should be prioritized too they were speechless. What they meant to say is that they knew I was never coming back there to give them my money again so the manager does not care whether I am satisfied or not. I am just waiting to see what they will reply to that review üòÇ",1,"Mr Zongo,

I will never go back. Here are some of the reasons why:

1- The ambiance is chaotic, they don't seem to know who has appointments, who is a new or returning client.
2- The reception area is messy , there aren't enough chairs, it is dirty and disorganised.
3- Reception staff are inexeperienced and unprofessional, it seemed that every intereaction they had with any client was problematic and unclear.
4- Most staff interactions with clients were rude.
5- I was ordered around, asked several times why I was there, who my appointment was with, where my form was, and why I was sitting where I was sitting. Basically, they have no idea what is happening. I was asked to move to different rooms, before seeing the doctor for the consultation.  Up the stairs , down the stairs, go here, sit there, why are you in here? , go wait downstairs... completely choatic.
6- The doctor was ''fine'', although we were interrupted at least 3 times by various staff members asking questions and divulging information about other clients to the doctor in front of me!  Truly unprofessional.
7- After nealry an hour of being shuffled around, I was finally seen by the nurse/injectables person, and agreeing on the amout of units she litterally stabbed the needle in.  When my dermatologist does it, it is painless.  After the injections here I had lumps, bled, and still have bruises 3 days later.
8- Their pricing is complicated and unclear: rebate codes, ''specials'' it seems like they make it up as they go along.

I will stick with my dermatologist.  I would rather pay slightly more... because this place is not worth it.",4,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

I would definitely come back should I want to do multiple areas! Parking is accessible and abundant! I appreciate the doctor and nurses, they were kind and gentle with me. They did not rush me and answered my questions sufficiently!

However, I can't say the same for those working at the reception and certain nurses depending on which day of the week you come in. I feel their tone and choice of words are condescending. The customer service is not streamlined and not well communicated - sometimes feels lost. It always seems they are improvising as they work hence, I feel like the kind of process they have in place is questionable and lacks. Worst, the level of professionalism is poor. It's really a turn-off because they deal with people face to face and over the phones and yet, I don't think they have the right and genuine soft skills required for the job.",1,Thank you very much for your thoughtful and detailed feedback.

I was told yes, they did, and proceeded to make an appointment for a free consultation. When I arrived at the facility I filled out all the paperwork and put a credit card on file. I was told that after the consultation with the injector, I would have to have another consultation with the doctor (due to government requirements) in which there was a fee of $130. They told me the Doctor was not on site, and that the nurse would call her from her phone and hand the phone to me. This seemed very shady and unprofessional.  During my initial free consultation with the nurse, she told me they did not inject the ptyergoid muscles as I was initially told, but that they did all the other muscles.  I became very uncomfortable with their business practices and the fact that they lied about their services to get me through the door and then tried to trap me into services. I immediately left the business and did not proceed with the $130 consultation with the doctor as I had no intentions on proceeding with any services however I was still charged for that service. I tried to contact the business for a refund without success. I demand a refund for the service that was never rendered.

After taking anti-biotics and letting weeks pass, I went to see the nurse at the clinic, and she said it is not caused by their injections. I felt that my chin got worse than what it was initially and wanted to change the treatment to cool sculpting as it was less invasive.

They have amazing hours too they close at 9 so you can go after work or school. I would recommend full body if you‚Äôre in the market. My sessions where an hour and a half on average. ‚ÄºÔ∏è but their numbing cream IS A MUSTTT it‚Äôs 60 bucks but money well spent you don‚Äôt need a lot and just need to put it on sensitive areas 30 minutes before.I recommend to put it anywhere where you‚Äôre lasering on your face,armpits,bikini and butt crack‚ÄºÔ∏è Get prepared to spend a good hour shaving because that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre allowed to do and they don‚Äôt do the shaving for you.I started with fatona laser and when switched to Darwin. The difference is that fatona is an elevated laser on dry skin and therefore better when your hair is thicker but it‚Äôs more painful. But the fatona and a cooling part attached to the laser which makes it less painful. Darwin is directly on the skin but there‚Äôs a layer of very messy gel. This gel protects the skin and makes the laser glide. I am a bit disappointed that they kept switching aestheticians on me. these are the aestheticians I had. ( I am missing one because I can‚Äôt remember her name)
Anna- only works at night very good and non apologetic she‚Äôs there to do her job and do it right. Not afraid to higher the intensity of the laser. (There to give you the best results) tiana- super kind and a bit timid she always asks if you‚Äôre ok. She‚Äôs a bit afraid to higher the intensity of the laser. Because it will cause you pain.
Sara- only had her once she was really good. She had laser done on her self so you knows what it‚Äôs like and is very mindful but also confident in what she is doing.
Natalia- only works during the day she‚Äôs amazing she‚Äôs been doing her job for over 11 years she has lots of experience and she works with men too. So nothing surprises her. Over all they are very accommodating but it was just disappointing that they kept changing it up seeing as you‚Äôre showing your full body to professionals but in the end strangers.",2,"Thank you for the review Chaya, and for being a great client!

My sister and I went here for eight sessions of laser hair removal and it only worked about 50% for both of us ‚Äì we still have hair left. We now have to go to Victoria Park to finish the other 50%. The technician had been using the machine at a lower intensity so as to make it less painful for us, but she did not tell us that using it at a lower intensity made the treatment less effective (we just figured she had to pass the machine over the target areas a few more times at the lower intensity, she did not explain to us that it is less effective). Why would we go through a process that was still painful even at the lower intensity only to not see any results at the end? It's the technician's job to explain how the process works and make sure it is done effectively, but she did not do this. We were only told about the reduced efficacy of the lower intensity when we called to complain that the treatment was not working and we wanted our money back. The manager refused to speak to us or return our calls, so clearly they do not even care about their business ‚Äì extremely rude and disrespectful. The secretary offered us an extra session, but why would we accept another session of a treatment that doesn't work?? Don't go here: the technician does not know how to deliver effective treatment (or at the very least to communicate about it, but who knows, maybe she didn't even know that lower intensity was less effective since it was the secretary who told us this, not the technician) and the manager is rude and clearly doesn't care about their business. What a waste of time and money.

In response to the owner's response: yes it's true you spoke to my mother but I was in the room when she was on the phone every time she called and she BEGGED to have a manager called her back and no manager ever did. So please do not call your customer a liar... it's not a good look for your business. Also, my sister and I never tanned. Neither of us use self-tanner, nor have we ever. We have barely left the house since March 2020 because of covid, so we actually did not even tan in the summer and we certainly were not tanned in the freezing Montreal winter. For people reading this review, for reference, my foundation shade at MAC is NW18 (I wore it throughout summer 2020, fall 2020 and winter 2021 because I didn't darken because I was inside all the time), and my sister is basically the same, so if that's tan then I honestly don't know who your service works on. Also, I am 21 and my sister is 18, so clearly you didn't even read my file right. Both of us have also had many friends our age do laser hair removal at other clinics and it worked perfectly for ALL of them, so it's just not true that being younger affects it. I know you offered us extra sessions, but why would we accept more of a service that doesn't work? If you don't want to refund us in any capacity, that's totally fine, but I just want to let other people know not to waste their money like my sister and I did. I wish you all the luck in improving your business.",19,"We‚Äôre sorry to hear about your disappointment, but we would like to clarify a few points in response to your review.

I have been a client for many years and had multiple services in Ideal Body Clinic.

In fact some doctors I went to see do not do it.
Second every time that I come I am very well explained the product that will be used on me and my expectations are well set. I had never been promised more then I have received.... waiting time... I guess some clients do not realize that working with people might have a delays and this is not the job that you want the nurse to rush.
I am extremely satisfied with all the services I received.

If I could give 0 stars I would.
I had purchased a Groupon deal for laser hair removal in September & went for my first treatment. I am half black, half white & I'm a 4 on the fitzpatrick scale; meaning I need specific lasers but I didn't know this prior (any trained tech is supposed to know this). The tech (initial ""M"") was kind and continuously asked if I was fine when I was having my treatment. It hurt a A LOT. I had laser treatments before but assumed the amount of pain was normal because the machine looked older.

The next day I burned and the day after I went back to Ideal body to let them know ask how I should take care of them. The head tech, Julia, asked M if everything was done correctly (lowest temp, gel applied, etc.) and M and I told her that she took all necessary steps. So I went back on October 31 for my second appointment, this time with Julia. This woman brings me to THE EXACT SAME MACHINE that burned me!? She said ""I wouldn't burn with her"". I told Julia, and she should already know this, that it wasn't M's fault, but that the machine is too strong for my skin type. After doing research before my appointment, I told her that the best laser for dark skin is a Diode or YAG (this is FACT). Julia insists I try the laser again 'because I burned due to the last tech', but Julia KNEW ""M"" did everything she was supposed to. M was a great tech and I was disappointment that Julia was snakey enough to try to blame her colleague but also stupid enough to blame a colleague after all three of us confirmed together that it wasn't  M's fault, but the machine?

I'm getting upset and Julia finally brings me to the owner, Veronika, who is sitting in the lobby in a chair. I ask her if we could speak in a more private setting as I'm about to bring up the burns (and didn't want to scare any customers in the lobby) and she said she does not want to move because she is comfortable. Okay. So I proceed to explain how I need a different machine than the one that burned me, or a refund and Veronika said it would cost me $400 MORE to use the YAG. I decline as the Groupon already cost me $310 and I was not ready to pour any more money into a business who seemingly does not care about their clients.
I obviously decline and request a refund and Veronika denies my request. I tell her that Groupon will issue a refund if the salon deems that I'm not a suitable candidate and since I burned from the treatment, I'm pretty sure I would not be considered a suitable candidate.
Guys, I'm really standing in this hallway having to explain to a grown woman how burns are painful, I'm scarred from their machine and I'm not continuing with my treatments. The owner asks me to come into the hallway to show her my burns, I do so and she ACTUALLY ASKS ""how do we know those were because of us?"". I'm now livid and say ""check your file"" and instead of doing so, Veronika turns to Julia and says ""did you see any burns?"" If Julia lied at this point I was going to be suing lol. Julia tells the truth and admits that I had burned and come in after but that ""the burning is normal."" Well, let me tell you, BURNING IS NOT NORMAL FOR LASER AND ANY TECH WHO THINKS SO SHOULDN'T BE WORKING AS A TECH.

Defeated, Veronika says I can get into contact with Groupon. As I'm leaving the salon, all three of the young receptionists are whispering as they look at my file together (extremely unprofessional). Still, at least SOMEBODY finally checked my file.
I filed a complaint with Groupon and they refunded me but I never went into the salon to refund my taxes ($40+)  they can keep it, they obviously need it after the hassle they gave me over a refund.
Just check how Ideal Body handles the negative reviews, instead of trying to remediate the customer, they blame the customer.
If you decide to do business at ideal Body, best of luck to you.

Their business is run off of offers like Groupon (never a good sign when you have to heavily discount your services and don't get return busines), and they don't even honour the fine print they advertise.
I bought a laser hair removal package and it was a huge waste of time and money. If the people performing the treatments really are certified estheticans, which I doubt, they definitely need refresher courses. For example, their IPL machine would heat my skin and I would feel like I was going to be burned, even though they used low settings. This never occurred elsewhere I had treatments. Turns out the machine needs to be on for at least 5 minutes for the cooling tip to have a chance to be effective, and at my treatments, they flipped the machine on and started immediately. Even after I showed them their own manual they refused to respect how the machine should be used!  And they wanted to ice my skin instead,  applying an ice pack directly to my skin which isn't supposed to be done.
Because they didn't use the machine properly, the setting was kept very low, and I did a year of treatments for nothing. I have seen more dramatic change after one treatment elsewhere than I did after a year of treatments here.

What a scam and waste of time!  They should be ashamed.",17,"Dear Aura,

this is like a factory
1- Waited over 1 hour and 15mn before they would see me, even if I had an appointment

2- Doctor too busy to say what he has to say to listen to me, the client

3- waited another 15mn in the room

4- had to ask for the region to be disinfected before the precedure

5- it's not clean

6- try to push me to buy more product

7- Did not inject me in the region where I specifically ask to be treated

8- the nurse was so rough, I still cannot believe it

9- did not ask me once if I was ok, no thank you or goodbye when I left

it is seriously the WORST service I ever had in my entire life! I don't know how come they still have a licence and still are open!

The staff was cold and I found the general atmosphere uncomfortable, especially with Veronica, whose behavior seemed strange to me, she rarely smiles and she sees her customers as wallets rather than people. I asked her if she was going to inject the same product as the last appointment and she replied ""I don't remember the product, I don't have your file with me"" HAHAHAHA BUT REALLY, THERE'S A LOT OF LAUGHINGüòÇ
I had to wait 1.5 hours for my first appointment and 30 minutes for the second, which is unacceptable. Additionally, I was made uncomfortable by the manner in which my care was discussed in front of others, including disclosing the price out loud. I have never seen a clinic apply the anesthetic and take pictures in the waiting room. It's HORRIBLE. This is an unacceptable and disrespectful practice. I will never return to this clinic again. Not to mention that I traveled to Sherbrooke for my second appointment without being informed that he was actually in Monkland. I made the trip until I realized I was at the wrong branch. I found myself driving an extra 50 minutes due to a communication error on their part, with no apology or compensation for the time lost.

The nurses are inexperienced and don‚Äôt seem to know what they‚Äôre doing. My last visit was supposed to correct the damage, but after the treatment, the area started bleeding heavily. Instead of controlling the bleeding, the nurse panicked, leaving me to handle it myself.

When I informed patient care, Sara told me the bleeding was 'normal.' Even if that‚Äôs true, shouldn‚Äôt the nurses know how to respond to it? She treated my concerns casually, with no regard for my feelings or the hard-earned money I‚Äôve wasted.

Then they took me to the room for my injections. The nurse was really sweet explained everything to me and knew exactly what she was doing. Very professional.

I had some difficulty getting into the clinic because there was sidewalk construction directly in front of the door where the sidewalk was being demolished by jackhammers. My ears ached.

I was about to choose the service when she was already at the front desk waiting for her next appointment. The lack of compassion and rude behaviour is reflective of the lack of respect for the client. I question whether their business model has the client‚Äôs best interest in mind or is driven by receiving funds for undelivered services. I did not raise my voice but did ask the consultant why it was that she raised her voice. She said ‚Äúbye bye‚Äù indicating the door. Shocked by this, I told the one and only client there at the time that she ought to be careful.

Real scam is they actually do NOT inject full 20 or 25 units! Pay attention to syringe they only inject 4-5 units, if you purchased 20 units you will get only 5 or max 7 units. Girls PAY ATTENTION what they injecting and count the units in a syringe! This company is scam.

She is the most lovely person.  She truly knows her stuff.  I was getting Botox and lip filler.  I told her to do whatever she felt was best for my lips and she did just that!!

I love them!! I will say that I am a bit bruised...but that could totally just be me and honestly I don't care (lol).  Also, the cream that she used to numb my lips is amazing.  I barely felt anything.  Usually it is a lot of painful pricks. Kailey said that they use a higher concentrate of numbing cream - so you will be happy!

I first visited Skin Vitality (Eglington) in late June (26) and wanted to try Dysport. I was a bit nervous but I met the lovely Kailey who was very warm, friendly and welcoming towards me. Knowing im a newbie, she gave me all the pertinent information i needed and not only answered all my questions but made me feel at ease. I then was introduced to Chelsea who would administer the injectables and there are not enough words to express how amazing she is - i felt well attended to and taken care of the entire time i was at the clinic.

I‚Äôve previously left a positive review but as a repeat customer who has spent $1000‚Äôs of dollars here, I have changed my opinion. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the high turnover of staff but I dealt with all new people at my last appointment. Way too many staff behind the counter to greet you, yet they were not very informative or friendly, seems their only job is to look you up and down upon arrival and obtain health info. Giving 2* for the cleanliness and ease of getting an appointment (which should be a telling sign in itself). However, very unprofessional. The consultant didn‚Äôt seem very knowledgeable, so other than offering promotions, not sure what her job is. She recommended over 80 units of dysport, which was either over diluted (they have a reputation for this which I chose to ignore), or grossly insufficient. Yet, I‚Äôve never had this much injected before and have had better results with less at other clinics. Soon after my appointment, the consultant emailed and called several times to say SHE made a mistake and undercharged me $9. It seemed very petty and off putting to expect a repeat customer who has spent a lot of money there to be harassed for someone else‚Äôs mistake and especially for such a nominal amount. My daughter also comes here for her lips, so they basically lost 2 customers over hounding me for their $9 mistake. Not professional at all. Not satisfied with the results either this time and although my daughter returned after her last visit because her lips where uneven, all they offered was to dissolve it rather than fix the asymmetry that they caused. If you‚Äôre on a budget and looking for good promotions- this may be your place, but it‚Äôs costing me more to now go somewhere else to add more dysport. But beware, the rumours of over diluting may be accurate and when they make mistakes - either in billing or filler asymmetry, it‚Äôs all put on the customer. High staff turnover may be a telling sign as well. They used to let me and my daughter have our consultations together but this time didn‚Äôt allow that, I felt they were trying to up sell her so wouldn‚Äôt let me sit in on her consult, seemed sketchy.",,Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Wonderful customer care.  Lovely clinic.    Very pleased with my initial results and extremely thorough, talented nurse injector.   Although, the touch up was with a new injector, mistakes can happen and unfortunately I experienced an asymmetrical, dropped eyebrow and lid with a misshapen eye.  Although this was an extremely difficult experience, the staff was sympathetic, apologetic and  understanding - I was offered a future do-over free of charge as reimbursement.   Accidents happen and we can never be sure the rare wonky face won‚Äôt happen to us (most people who receive Botox injections will experience some degree of asymmetry at some point).   The point is, they rectified the situation as best as was possible with understanding and a high standard of customer care.   There was no fix but to wait for the Botox to wear off and my face to return to normal.   I would recommend asking your injector to carefully read your file and take the time with you to fully understand your needs and desired outcome before beginning - as my first one did.

If you are considering any of the services they provide, I suggest going here. They stand behind what they do and actually care about their clients. They will go the extra mile for people.

It was not. They pride themselves in empowering clients and making them feel confident. I left feeling the opposite. Instead I was shamed, blamed and judged.

They lack insight, compassion, empathy, and sensitivity. They failed to establish trust and did not provide opportunities for informed decision making. It‚Äôs evident that their intention is to make a sale. They did not take the time to inquire about my skin care journey, skin care routine, and lifestyle. Instead they pushed TeslaMed on me claiming that it would be the ONLY option for my acne/scarring/fine lines. The cons/complications and failure rates were not disclosed until I asked. The manager said there were no complications‚Ä¶

I was told that I had to commit to 5 treatment for $2000. The manager told me I had to purchase 4+1 complementary treatments for $2000 or else it would be $750 a session. I told her I wanted to do one session at a time because I didn‚Äôt want to commit to something that might not work for me. I was happy to pay $750 each session. She said,  ‚ÄúIs this a cost issue or a trust issue? Lots of people have financial issues these days. I can start an invoice for you for $500‚Äù. I said it was 100% a trust issue.

I chose to bring in my skin care products and medications. The manager never asked me about my regimen over the phone, she did not ask me to bring in my products. I take birth control for endometriosis, and spironolactone for my acne. She said she‚Äôs never heard of spironolactone and asked her colleague to google it. This was surprising because she claims to have ‚Äúbeen in skincare for 23 years‚Äù. Spironolactone is commonly used to control hormonal acne. She kept calling it an antibiotic (which it is not). She looked at my skin care products and said that it was probably good because they were Korean/Japanese products. She did not ask me how or when I used them.

She offered me a complementary trial of TeslaMed. Throughout the treatment the aesthetician gave me advice about healing myself from ‚Äúwithin‚Äù. When I explained my skin concerns she said,  ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre suffering from something for so long, it manifests inside‚Äù. She then went on about the benefits of an organic diet, Ayurvedic medicine, syncing my treatment according to the placement of the moon, herbal medicine. She also said that because I eat pork I ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù have parasites ‚Äúpooping and peeing‚Äù inside of me making me crave sweets. She said I should see a homeopath and get a colonic wash. She also said I was retaining fluid in my jaw and needed to do lymphatic exercise everyday. She said I should drink spearmint tea, apple cider vinegar, tumeric and ginger. I should cut out pork and sugar, and eat organic. She then said I need to be happy and stress free. She said I need to stop birth control because I will have issues having kids. She said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in pills. When I started eating organic and cut out all these things and ayurevedic medicine and treating myself according to the moon my period cramps went away.‚Äù She said if I cut out things slowly I will see a change in my health and my weight.

All of this advice was given without inquiring about my lifestyle, diet, skin care routine, skin care journey. I have been suffering from acne since I was a teen. I‚Äôve been on accutane, different methods of birth control, and skin care regimens. I recently had bloodwork done and my hormone levels are normal. I live an active and healthy lifestyle, and recently lost 40lbs. I am in my 30s and for 2025 I decided to invest in treatment to address my acne scarring/acne/fine lines. I was excited to start this journey but it was ruined by this experience. I will not be coming back and will never recommend this spa to anyone.",2,"We sincerely apologize for your negative experience, Candice.

I went in to ask about botox- and was talked into the new Tesla machine. $4k and a few treatments later, I notice no different in my texture or sagginess. I ended up getting botox anyways. I returned a few months later to ask about a blood vessel to have removed and was told you can not target one spot and I would need to do the while face. For $2400, they could do that. I walked down the street to a dermatologist, had it targeted for $200 plus had 3 facials in the package. Soooo disappointed in myself for wasting $4000 here- I know better. Be warned- they are SALES PEOPLE. They will say anything to see expensive treatments that in my experience, didn't do a single thing.",2,"Dear Amanda,

In the previous consultation she ask what I want, I said just need some Botox, she also told me that I need fillers and she got a great promotion and bla!!!! So as she ‚Äúwas the expert I said ok, so i ended buying 100 units more the filler,  she do the units (no even 70) and she told me that I have to come back after 7 days to see if I need a touch up and she would do for free ( IF COURSE!!!  She didn‚Äôt use what I pay for, I asked for a mirror and I point a few spots where I need more. ISNT SHE THE PROFESSIONAL???  btw my first time that I need to go twice for the same job, the  excuse was to see where we gonna put the filler. When I went she said ohh YOU NO NEED IT!!!! So.  WHY SHE ASK ME TO BUY IT ON FIRST PLACE!!!  Now  she offered another treatment and obviously I won‚Äôt be so stupid to be treated there.

Another thing that I forgot to comment is that I don‚Äôt know if your nurse or is all of them .. she didn‚Äôt even clean the area to be treated, i remember when they used  to clean your face, disinfect the area and then apply, super professional, this time super cheaper and really bad doing.

And yes I do hope that u can do something whit this situation and don‚Äôt leave it for the next time

Besides being very personable and knowledgeable regarding all the related services available at New You to help one achieve their cosmetic objectives, Tatia Is very observant and ensures you are comfortable throughout the procedure at all times.

This novel treatment is non invasive and very well tolerated by clients, even those with sensitive skin, like myself. The results are cumulative and will continue to develop over time as one‚Äôs underlying facial architecture is improving from the inside out.

I‚Äôm very pleased with Tatia and with the New You Spa in general. The facility is very tastefully designed and decorated. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. And the New You, at the Davisville location provides clients with complimentary underground parking in the building just adjacent to their facility. Even the parking attendants there are extremely pleasant and professional.

I would be remiss if I did not mention Nasrin, the Cosmetic Consultant who was extremely helpful in guiding me through selecting the best services for my current interests.

Suffice to say, I am very pleased with the New You facility and with the services I received, especially from Tatia as she truly cares about her New You clients and their wellbeing. I look forward to the feedback I will be receiving at my university class reunion at the end of October 2024.

The New You Spa has been in business for many years and the reasons are self evident: Employing leading edge and evolving technologies in the anti-aging/cosmetic sector; Having a client centric model of service delivery that excels at every level; Featuring fabulous promotions throughout the year for existing and new clients to give themselves an opportunity be the best they can be; and hiring individuals like Tatia to deliver a level of expertise, you only normally find in the most luxurious of European Spas. As a famous actor once said: I‚Äôll be back.

She takes her time to thoroughly consult and perform treatments, ensuring the best results without rushing.

Dr. Nesrin's follow-up care is outstanding; she always wants to see the results in a few weeks to determine if a touch-up is necessary, which I find very reassuring.

The receptionists are always available and incredibly kind. I've had particularly great interactions with Sophia. When my file couldn't be found in the system, she went above and beyond to assist me and resolve the issue.

I‚Äôve been very satisfied with my experience at New You Yonge & Davisville and will continue to come back. Highly recommend!",,"Hi Wranga, thank you for your heartfelt review! We're thrilled to have had the privilege of serving you for 5 wonderful years at New You Yonge & Davisville. ‚Ä¶ More"

This time the injections were provided by Nasrin who is a super health care professional, originally a dermatologist. She gave me lots of advice and listened attentively to my issues. She was very gentle carefully avoiding all possible blood vessels and even called me back several times to see how the injections were working out for me. I would definitely give her a 5-star rating but nowadays they are using exclusively a German-made filler, called Amalian that does not have very good lifting properties. It is good for filling up places under sagging skin but it didn't give me the desired lift I was hoping for. Nasrin suggested Ion stream 680 treatments for lifting purposes which I might try in the future.

But this one is highly warranted. Save your money. DO NOT go to this clinic. All around bad experience - for both me and my sister. We both had similar experiences and I feel terrible that I even told her about this spot when I first started to visit. However, in this case, I will speak for myself.

I went to this ""clinic"" (if you can even call it that) to help with some scarring I had. I told them I did not want to buy a package because I wanted to try a few sessions first to see how I responded. After 2-3 sessions (individually purchased), they convinced me. I stupidly listened to the clearly unqualified, incompetent individuals at this clinic and bought a package because ""it would save me money."". Turns out I was not responding to the treatment because the clinic technicians had NO IDEA what they were doing. So of course, I wanted my money back for the portion of the package I did not use. It has been years (pre-pandemic) now and they still refuse to refund my money I am owed for the services I have not used. I have called several times. SEVERAL... and they refuse to give me the head office number or even their email! Terribly unprofessional. And cannot forget that I was once yelled at (and sworn to) by this location's MANAGER.

When I initially purchased my 6 body sculpt, 3 EMS and 2 skin tightening some of those were freebies but they didn't tell me the purchase was non-refundable and charged me before showing me the contract. Then on my first session I was constantly bombarded to upgrade to 12 paddles and now the comments of yeah we can do your goals in 6 paddles during the assessment turned into you need 12 paddles for our vision and this was all within the same day.
I was seeing results but not a lot so I decided to get all my treatments done to get it all over with. I asked to schedule my final session with body sculpt, EMS and skin tightening all in one day and they said yes.Come appointment time they changed my appointment on me and said its just body sculpt because all 3 isn't safe which fine, but why approve it in the first place. I schedule the EMS and skin tightening another time and decided to call them JIC and here's my issue they said my appointment is just for skin tightening and that I only ordered 5 body sculpt, 2 EMS and 2 skin tightening. I raised issues with this and they offered to give me the EMS but honestly decided to just give up the freebie because I don't want to deal with the headache if they decided not to or push for an up-sell or something else on me,I got all 6 of my body sculpt done anyways.

Afterwards, in late 2021, when places started opening up again I went to the Davisville location to use the remaining 9 treatments. Let me tell you the women who work there are rude and this 1 in particular (an oldish 50 something lady with black mid-length hair) yelled at the top of her lungs, literally screamed at me because I was trying to get into the office while it was locked (I didn‚Äôt know why it was locked). She yelled at me so loudly that I literally cried on the spot & no one from that location bothered to come and talk to me, give me an apology of any sort or anything for that matter. Such nasty, rude & obnoxious behaviour is worth remarking on. I wish nothing but the worst on that lady who yelled at me.

They also told me that they will give sessions for certain areas that were not covered during previous sessions but I did not go as I am not stupid enough to travel so far for just certain areas which was their mistake in the first place.

My laser services were far below my expectations, and I left every appointment feeling extremely upset. The staff members were consistently rude and condescending towards me, which only added to my frustration.

To make matters worse, the services promised to me were not fulfilled. Despite being told that certain elements of my services would make it less painful, I was refused these options during my appointments. This was particularly frustrating because I had explicitly requested these accommodations and was promised that they would be provided.

Whenever I raised concerns about these issues, someone would promise me a solution that was never fulfilled. It was clear that the staff members did not communicate with each other or keep any records of our conversations. Even though I asked them to document our discussions, I was always met with confusion and frustration.

The final straw came when they tried to charge me for an extra session without being notified beforehand. The staff had not kept track of my  pre-purchased sessions, and I was allowed to come in for an extra session without realizing it would cost me more money. When I was informed of the charge after they performed the services, I felt like I had been deceived and taken advantage of.

Overall, I cannot recommend this spa clinic based on my experience. The poor quality of the services, coupled with the unprofessional behaviour of the staff, left me feeling extremely disappointed and frustrated.",7,"Hi Samantha, we acknowledge your frustration, and we are genuinely sad to hear that we did not meet your expectations.

The consultant offer me a discount for a package of 8 since I got the laser package. I was intrigued and went on to pay for both in full. Before my first appointment I found out I was unexpectedly pregnant, I called to see if I could get a refund since I didn‚Äôt know when I was able to start the treatments. They offered to freeze the packages for as long as needed. This past month I went in for my first teeth whitening and was made aware that they no longer have the charcoal whitening product and that this was a rare treatment for them to provide. I felt uncomfortable knowing this but wanted my teeth whitened as I see on Instagram many people get this done with great results. I went ahead and had the treatment with what I think was a product ordered just for my attendance since I complaint about not being able to get the service I paid for and asked for a refund. It did nothing! The manager at the front desk was rude and dismissive when I asked her questions about continuing with the other services. I felt so insulted that I emailed costumer service to tell them I don‚Äôt feel good going back to this location. The other manger (sorry I didn‚Äôt get names) called to inform me she‚Äôs aware that I reached out to costumer service and would like to discuss ‚Äúmy issue‚Äù. When I called back, the office is closed. I tried emailing costumer services and using the message option on their website but no reply. Costumer service is just horrible and I feel really disrespected at this point. I didn‚Äôt start the treatment and all I wanted was a refund for my hard worked money. I have a baby to care for but they don‚Äôt seem to care about that. How can I go to all these appointments with a baby, I can‚Äôt keep getting a sitter. Especially, when the treatments don‚Äôt work.

All I‚Äôm advising is that you turn the other way and visit a different spa. It maybe a little more pricy but worth it at the end. That is if you like being treated with decency. I hope they fix this ‚Äúissue‚Äù as I do plan to reach out to the business bureau or get legal help.",13,

The Bad: Bodisculpt 360 is ineffective.

I spent $9,605 (inc tax) on 18 sessions during a Black Friday sale in 2021. The sales person said this was sufficient for eliminating my bra line fat and for achieving a flat upper & lower abdomen.

After 12 months of sessions, you want to know the result? 0.5mm off the bra line, no change in the upper abdomen, and a 1mm INCREASE in the lower abdomen (from 25mm to 26mm).  My weight decreased by 3.5lbs, but this was due to external factors. I did everything they asked: I exercised regularly, reduced my salt intake, massaged the areas, drank 2L of water every day, accepted 3 complementary sessions, and waited 2 months before coming back to do another round of measurements.

Yes, it's true my fat is extremely stubborn, especially around my waist. (That's why I lost weight without any real fat changes.) But isn't that what body sculpting is for? Their website says ""We spent 3 years traveling the world to discover the best technology available"", which translates into ""we looked for the cheapest machine in Asia that looks fancy.""

It was very thoughtful of them to offer 3 free sessions, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars. What I really wanted though was my money back.

Even though the sales person had given me a verbal agreement that I would be satisfied, I was ignorant enough to still sign the digital contract, which clearly states they're not responsible for the results. Now I know why.

So please learn from my very expensive mistake. If you have $10,000 and unwanted fat, this is what you should do instead of spending your money here:
. $4,000 on AirSculpt
. $2,400 on biweekly personal training sessions for 1 year
. $1,200 on a monthly nutritionist
. $2,400 on biweekly therapy. Because if you are gullible enough to believe a beauty clinic salesperson when they say $10,000 of Bodisculpt 360 can remove stubborn fat, then you have deep psychological issues.

Take my advice. Don't end up emotionally and financially miserable like me. I don't think I will ever forgive myself for this.",1,"Hello Taylor , I am unable to locate you as a client so can you please call the clinic at 4164877848 so that I can discuss your concerns. Thanks"

I Got three coolsculpting treatments done so more than $3500 spent and I don't see any difference in the area I got treated.
It has been 6 months since I got the first treatment done and 2 months since I got the last 3rd treatment done. My last treatment was really bad the machine kept coming out and I had to hold it and when I told that to the nurse she said said ""oh really sorry about that"". I didn't pay so much money for that response. Then I was offered a free facial which I wasn't much interested in. Because I paid thousands for coolsculpting  not facial. I wanted to see results which I was promised. I hope they will know that its not good to give bad service. I don't know why I got this kind of service. I am just an immigrant in this country and specially during COVID times, it's so hard to earn money. I realize it was my big mistake to just relly on their google reviews and not completely researching if this was the best place to get coolsculpting done. They would schedule my appointment on the day when there was no technician available.

Worst customer service, no commitment, they take zero responsibility of their treatments.
Constantly change of staff and keep no records on your treatments and what they are doing to you.
I was sold their 6 month unlimited package last year for over 7K... the girl was very good to sale it to me while promising services and that I could visit all their locations.
To start, no one was ever able to give me a full list of all services included in my package even after asking multiple times.
I visited other locations since the Yorkville one where I bought my package was too hard for me to get on a weekday appointment. I was literally told not to ever come back in Oakville when I went to try to get my appointments there and was told they didn't even have access to my file nor bothered to look for it to check that I was able to visit all locations.
Appointments were constantly cancelled or rescheduled because their equipment was not working or they mistakenly double booked appointments.
The girl that originally sold me the package was one at some point and no one was able to know what my package included since there was no information in my file other than the amount paid.
Close the the end of my package I asked to speak with the new manager and was even given an appointment which then I realized was not with her but another girl that all she wanted was to sale me more laser sessions because of course I never saw any changes with the 6 sessions I had... I was told that the manager was away in Vegas...
The ONLY ones that I can say were doing a great job and tried to help me were Nadine and Alicia at the Sherway location. Nadine pretty much runs the location on her own.. at least for what I saw and she was amazing. Unfortunately the overal experience was terrible.",14,"Hi Monica, we are very sorry to hear about your experience and the confusion you had with your treatments.

When we reached there they failed to offer hydra facial as their machine was working. Very unprofessional as they didnt feel the need to inform us before hand. And when i asked if we come someother time for hydra , what time can you give us , she has no clarity on that either.

I am disappointed since these spas and clinics , all they care is about money and no customer service.

The procedure itself was fine for me. For my fiance , his neck was not cleaned properly and the technician also accidentally spilled the mask in his eyes.",1,

I‚Äôve been coming here for years for Botox/Dysport. Appointments are easily booked online and I get a confirmation text a couple days before.

The clinic is located inside of a hair salon on the lower level. There‚Äôs a sign out front so it‚Äôs easy to find.

It‚Äôs small but elegantly decorated for comfort.

Carol and nurse Nasrin always have a quick chat with me at the beginning of my appointments to go over my history and my desired outcome for the treatment. They‚Äôll make recommendations and inject conservatively. You can always go for a touch up if needed.

Nurse Nasrin is the most gentle injector I‚Äôve ever experienced. She‚Äôs patient when I‚Äôm a baby about it and will give breaks if needed. I am always happy with the service.

It is a very busy clinic and the ladies do the best they can to run on time. I‚Äôm usually in and out of there really quickly which is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for.

And the best part is the price. It‚Äôs extremely reasonably priced for both Botox/Dysport and fillers especially when compared to other clinics.

I always get a follow up text from Carol with the next 2 days just checking in to make sure everything is ok, that‚Äôs a nice touch that shows they really care about their clients.

Fresh is my go to, I highly recommend it and I‚Äôll return over and over again.",,

I had six sessions for my face, and now, after a month, all the hair has grown back. When I was considering purchasing their facial laser package, I was told that if I didn‚Äôt get results, they would continue the sessions for free until I saw good results as part of their guarantee. However, when I brought this up, they went back on their word and said that the guarantee only applies to their other packages, not for facial treatments. This was very disappointing because I had seen on their website that they offer a guarantee, and I even double-checked with two of their staff members, both in person and over the phone, before paying the fee, and they confirmed this. But after my third session, when I mentioned that I wasn‚Äôt seeing any results, they didn‚Äôt care and told me to wait until the end of the sessions. Even after six sessions, I still didn‚Äôt see any results, and when I mentioned it to them, they just said it might be a hormonal issue and that they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. Meanwhile, in other places I‚Äôve had laser treatments, I didn‚Äôt see facial hair for at least seven months. Here, not only did I not see results between sessions (only about 30% of the hair was reduced), but now, after a month, I have full hair regrowth again. It feels really unfair that they lure you in with these promises before you pay, only to change their stance later. Additionally, some of their staff were neither respectful nor professional, and overall, it was a very bad experience for me.",,

I had a consultation appointment for Dysport, and felt pressured by Mabel, the Aesthetician, to make an appointment for the procedure itself despite me communicating that I was wary of proceeding with it. I was not communicated any of the side effects of the procedure during the consultation appointment itself and felt pressured to sign the medical consent forms and book the appointment quickly at the time of the consultation. Only until after the appointment, did I consult with a physician friend to understand that one of the most common side effects include facial weakness that can last up to a month along with blurred vision. After learning this, I called the clinic within 24 hours after I booked the appointment requesting that I cancel my appointment scheduled in two weeks time. I was received with extremely poor customer service whereby three different customer service managers (Margarita, Jessica and Sara) passed my issue along with form emails saying that they would not be able to issue a refund. In each template message, they expressed that they could not issue a refund of my deposit unless I had a physicians note whereby they would only just consider the request for refund. They displayed no accountability for not sharing the most common side effects, along with no empathy or compassion to the circumstances that I described, by which I was pressured to make an appointment at the time of the consultation. The customer service team took no accountability of their role in the situation or the reasonable solution of refunding me my deposit, and instead took a cold and detached approach at interacting with a long-time customers such as myself.",,

After it hurt and it bled a lot she LEFT the room a couple of times as she could not take the blood (unsanitary, bad process). Another esthetician came in and basically quickly scrapped the rest of my face, wiped the blood all over my raw face and told me to sleep with it (NOT normal procedure).

I have shared my experience with the clinic multiple times and asked for a refund of the session and my future session (which is the least they can do) and while they acknowledge the bad experience they felt it was worth keeping my money.

For your kind information, I was on time at 5:00pm as scheduled. Kindly get your facts clear. Don‚Äôt be rude when the fault is at your end. If you need I can share the google location details or cab arrival time if you can‚Äôt believe my words. Your receptionist kept me waiting till 5:22 pm before proceeding with new med form and appointment. **** My confirmed appointment was not showing in your system.

Highly unprofessional staff, no value of someone‚Äôs time. I went there with confirmed  appointment. But still at reception, I was informed that there is no appointment in my name. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible, do they share the confirmation text without scheduling consultation. Even before leaving for clinic, I called them; and they re-confirmed their location and the appointment time. On visit, had to wait for more than an hour, initial half an hour they took to figure out if appointment was there or not. And then after filling the med history form also waited for more than half an hour. So almost after waiting for more than an hour, staff comes and ask to reschedule for some other day. To my surprise they stated its my fault that delayed the schedule(which actually was a complete failure at their end)
The staff was not at all supportive or considerate. Would never recommend anyone in my circle.",3,"Hello Aastha,

I initially purchased a hair removal package, attracted by the promised results guarantee policy. However, my journey was fraught with inconsistency and frustration.

One of the biggest challenges was booking appointments with the same technician. Due to high demand, it was difficult to secure an appointment every 8 weeks with the same one. This inconsistency led to varying experiences with different technicians, ranging from thorough and attentive to rushed and painful. It was also disappointing to discover that the technicians I preferred no longer worked there, adding to the lack of continuity.

My ultimate disappointment came during my last assessment and appointment. The technician informed me of the 70% hair removal guarantee, which came as a surprise as I had not been previously informed. Despite this, I agreed to the two additional complimentary sessions she offered to address remaining hair growth. However, during the first of these sessions, the technician abruptly declared my hair was gone, contradicting her previous assessment and leaving me confused and unsatisfied.

The entire appointment was marred by the technician's negative and passive-aggressive demeanour, making me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. While I typically avoid confrontation, the unprofessionalism displayed during this session was unacceptable.

Overall, while I did see results from the sessions, the inconsistency in service quality and the disappointing conclusion to my experience left me with no desire to return for the final complimentary session or to Canada MedLaser in the future.",4,"Hello!

I‚Äôve been fortunate to have Mabel for my sessions. Her calm and kind manner puts me at ease. She will always pause during the session to ask if I‚Äôm doing okay and this warms my heart. But, what I love best about her is that she doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat and plays it straight. She‚Äôs always given me a realistic overview rather than ensure a miracle. Having said that, I consider my results as nothing short of miraculous. I‚Äôm planning to come back for semi-annual touch-ups and hope to have Mabel do them as well.

As an added bonus, the clinic is always neat and has such a peaceful vibe.

Clinic is extremely clean and they do a very good job at ensuring covid safety protocols are met. Aside from how clean and pretty this clinic is, the results are absolutely outstanding. I‚Äôve done 3 sessions so far, and after just ONE session I‚Äôm not even joking I saw 50% of my hair reduced. The hair that grows back is so thin. At 3 sessions the results are shocking... so so good. They have a policy where if you‚Äôre not happy with results after the year package is over you can keep going.. but I can‚Äôt see that as even being necessary. Having the guarantee is very comforting though. My skin is light and my hair is black so I am the ideal candidate for laser and maybe that is why my results have been so good. They also use an incredible machine. The prices are definitely pricey but I actually found them to be competitive with other clinics that offer this same machine. Lastly, what makes my experience really the best is Kayla. She is hands down amazing. I had so many anxieties coming in and she is just such an angel. She talks with you through everything that is going on and if she senses that your nervous she makes small talk to get your mind off of everything! I find her extremely through in the actual application of the machine (I never have patches of hair that were missed). She also will make sure that you‚Äôre okay in terms of discomfort. She‚Äôs honestly great. If I had to pick between  the convenient location, cleanliness of spa, AMAZING machine, and Kayla.. Kayla would be the reason I‚Äôm going to be here permanently and add more and more services. The rest are a close second though!",,

I‚Äôve been seeing Kayla for the last few months for laser hair removal. Kayla is very warm, friendly, meticulous, empathetic and knowledgeable, and is a true professional. She always takes extra care to ensure that everything runs smoothly ‚Äì from double checking my skin temperature to inquiring about any changes in medication, sun exposure, etc. Also, she explains everything and answers all my questions patiently and with so much detail and care ‚Äì I talk to her like I‚Äôm talking to a friend!

I‚Äôm a first timer so I was a little skeptical as I‚Äôm fairly dark-skinned and have thick hair so I wasn‚Äôt sure how well the laser would work on me. The laser treatment does hurt a little bit she made me feel safe and comfortable. I still have a few more sessions to go but am seeing amazing results after the first few treatments!

For example, in early May I received 30 units Botox in my forehead and eyes and a week later my remaining 20 units. All in my face. It was not applied correctly and I still had many muscles along the upper part of my forehead able to give me forehead wrinkles, in very odd shapes. By July all 50 units provided had been metabolized and my forehead and eyes able to move the same way as before.
I would highly recommend Toronto Dermatology or a real dermatologist clinic to provide good quality (and same price) Botox. Just in comparison, 22 units of Botox at my dermatologist clinic lasts 5.5 months versus 50 units at CanMedLaser lasted almost 3 months. Would not recommend.

My laser hair removal started pre-covid and had to pause due to the pandemic, but the team has been wonderful with honouring my year-long unlimited laser hair package.

In case anyone is considering laser hair removal (especially Brazilian), I 100% recommend it. I have tan/darker skin and the laser works absolutely great. The treatment will not only thin out your hair, but it will greatly reduce the volume of it, get rid of ingrowns, and slow down any hair growth (if you have any).

Mabel is excellent at making you feel comfortable during the procedure. It does hurt, but it takes less than a minute to complete so it‚Äôs worth the temporary pain.",,"Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write this outstanding review, TJ!

I had laser hair removal treatment here a few years ago. I signed up for 18 months but only completed about 12 due to being burned badly. The service was great until my 12th treatment, they increased the power of the laser and i was burned so bad all over the front of my chest and stomach I nearly needed to go to the hospital I was in so much pain. I received an email the next day with an apology for burning me which was great, but months and years later no follow up after that to see if I had healed. The doctor never reached out at all. I was just forgotten about. I'm sure I'm just the unlucky one as i see there are lots of great reviews for this place on google but thought I should let people know my experience.

Edit: Response to below
- I was not slightly tanned
-The laser was increased not decreased
-A thorough explanation was not given to me for treatment.
-I had no follow up visits after being burned by the laser
-I was not contacted several times about my recovery.

I felt valued up until the multiple burns, thank you for your time. I appreciate your response.",27,"Hi Troy,

She stopped the facial multiple times to tell me about the benefits of this machine, and how she was giving me the treatment that day for free, ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt tell them at the front or they‚Äôll charge you.‚Äù She went so far as to get a machine from the back and do a product demo - like ma‚Äôam I am trying to relax. When I told her I was not planning on spending 3 grand that day, she tried to tell me about a payment plan! I finally, sort of forcefully had to tell her I wasn‚Äôt interested, and she got into a huff about it. The facial itself was fine but I would caution anyone looking for a relaxing experience to go here.",3,"Hi Samantha, we are sorry to hear about your experience.

Yes.
Do I regret it?
Not one bit!

I had this place saved for a month because it's quite the commute from my area, but I went yesterday and y'all, the experience is something else!

The waiting area has comfy soft chairs, a little contest going on, a bowl of wrapped dark chocolate, and a friendly receptionist who will offer you water (maybe it's because my skin was crying for moisture üòÖ)

I had Dawn's do my initial consultation.

And instead of the 1 second finger poke to your cheek, like some places do, they have a whole machine that checks different spots on your face and assess your skin's age.

Afterward, Dawn explained what I'd have to do in a general sense, and then she asked if I had time to do a treatment that day.

Key words, she asked.

I wasn't pushed a product or an expensive treatment right off the bat.

Then she talked about 1 thing to try today that my skin would benefit from.

I forgot what it was called, but I think it was an oxygen hydrating facial thing (not one of the ones on promo) and when it was over I was glowing more than I had been the whole month!

Then, and only after that, when I asked what I should do next, that's when she suggested other services, packages, and products.

I felt encouraged but not pressured.

I also liked the custom reasoning of why this and not that.

Lastly, they do keep track of your progress with pictures if you permit.

Hands down best place, they actually care about your skin more than your wallet, and are so chill that I will obviously be back.",2,"Thank you for your lovely review and feedback, Leeann. We are grateful you enjoyed every minute of your time here. ‚Ä¶ More"

My experience at this clinic was horrendous, largely due to Roni, their Customer Service Manager. I initially booked a hydro facial with a promo but was later informed that the appointment was canceled due to a misunderstanding about a deposit link that expired before I could use it. The booking receptionist had told me to ""take my time"" with the link, but I wasn‚Äôt informed it had a 20-minute expiration.

When I called to clarify, Roni‚Äôs response was combative. She argued about what the receptionist had said and insisted she would review the recorded call, which felt unnecessary. Roni‚Äôs aggressive and argumentative demeanor caused me significant stress, particularly since I am five months pregnant. She kept me on the phone for nearly 10 minutes, focusing more on proving me wrong than finding a solution.

At the rebooked appointment, Roni had intercepted the appointment and pulled me over to the reception area, where she publicly accused me of having used the promo before, despite my statements that I didn‚Äôt recall doing so. Roni's aggressive behavior led to a 30-minute confrontation that left me physically and emotionally distressed, as I was shaking and sweating from the stress. She disregarded my explanations and continued to argue, ultimately pushing me toward a more expensive treatment.

Roni‚Äôs lack of empathy and judgment created a humiliating and unpleasant experience. Her actions not only affected me but also made the situation uncomfortable for other staff and clients. This clinic‚Äôs potential is marred by poor customer service and management. I strongly advise avoiding this place.",2,"We're truly sorry to hear about your experience, Mira.

My experience with Marah was pleasant and very informative. It is a shame that my experience changed once I got to the front desk person. I spent a least 20 minutes listening to this woman go on about the different promotions and treatments the business had to offer. This approach was rather annoying to be honest, especially since I was a new client. Considering I was coming back anyway for my facial treatment I was confused why she was trying so hard to sell me on other services. Finally after she exhausted all options to sell me more services her attitude immediately changed from welcoming to cold. I have never been dismissed so rudely in my life. Due to that interaction alone, I have decided to cancel my facial here, and go to Formula Fig. After reading other reviews from this place, I can definitely confirm this is a routine problem here and not a one time mistake. It is sad to say that the experienced professionals are not the reason why I will not return, but the pushy sales tactic.",8,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

I was there to receive the discounted hydra facial that‚Äôs initially $200.00 and was on for $60.00 plus tax (roughly this amount) I was asked if I wanted to come back to try more services right after my appointment.

During my second visit, I had Botox done (for my very first time) by Natalie and it went so smoothly. My results are amazing.

I have been getting Forma treatments at another clinic in Toronto for a few years, and when Clinique De Mode opened a location near me, I decided to give it a try.

I visited a week before my wedding, and the nurse suggested doing Forma on my forehead. This had never been recommended at my previous clinic, as they advised against it due to the skin being too thin. However, the nurse at Clinique De Mode assured me that it was safe, so she proceeded. Toward the end of the treatment, it became uncomfortably hot, and I had to ask her to stop. She reassured me that this was normal, but I left with a red spot on my forehead, which turned into a scar two days later.

I contacted the clinic to inform them of what happened, and they responded by downplaying my concern, stating that the mark was just hyperpigmentation and would eventually fade. They even offered to provide scar cream, which seemed contradictory if it was supposedly only hyperpigmentation.

I'm leaving this review because, two months later, the scar is still there. While the staff at Clinique De Mode were courteous, I don't believe they demonstrated the level of knowledge and professionalism that customers expect. Based on my experience, I would not recommend getting Forma treatments here.",9,

Hesitated on writing this review, but ultimately decided it can help others. I got a hydrafacial gold with Darlene the other day and I wish I hadn‚Äôt. The treatment seemed to go fine until she added Phloretin cf at the end. That product is drying due to the denatured alcohol, irritating to many based on reviews, and should never be used on someone who she agreed had dry/dehydrated skin. I used it years ago and got a bad reaction, and mentioned it after she applied it, and she said it would be okay as opposed to washing it off. Unfortunately, it caused the same reaction that started as I was going home, and just days before a vacation I was so excited about. After such an exfoliating facial, l-ascorbic acid which doesn‚Äôt agree with everyone shouldn‚Äôt be used especially on a first time client. I also felt leaving the peel on for 2 minutes was quite long, especially knowing I used retinol 3-5 days prior. She was very nice, but I feel someone more experienced would not have done certain things. Just something to keep in mind for the future.",11,Hi Tanisha. We appreciate your feedback. Darlene‚Äôs actually at our CDM Midtown Location (this is CDM Downtown) but we‚Äôll definitely forward this info over to them.

Going through that was totally worth it in the end because that lead me to trying out Clinique De Mode.
The staff here are so genuine. During my first visit, they told me HydraFacial is actually not suitable for my skin at the moment and suggested me a different procedure through solid reasoning. Vance and Sarah are both amazing at what they do and extremely easy going! Shoutout to Kerrie as well, she is a gem. She made me feel so welcomed at the front desk in all of my visits. I guess I showed a bit of insecurities; she reminded me every time that it is not as bad as how I look at myself in the mirror + it takes time. I also appreciate how she told me that what products work for her would not necessarily work for me.
The sad reality is that most skin spas undervalue how important a comfortable setting is for customers. I almost forgot what it was like to not be pestered during a treatment until I came here.
Clinique De Mode executes comfort so well and understand the importance of specialized skincare for different individuals (not blindly- suggesting products without knowing anything about the ingredients).

She DID NOT TRY TO sell me anything(skin care products or laser treatments) i did not need, which is really rare. The other laser clinics are always trying to sell you all kinds of treatment that you probably don't need. The entire treatment was very soothing, and the pain level was surprisingly insignificant. She really took her time doing the entire treatment. I had such an amazing experience I am coming back for a few more vampire facials with her.

I've been the victim of identity theft so I am perhaps I'm a little more sensitive than others.

I had completed the COVID questionnaire online before my appointment but I hadn't completed their medical history form.  I was asked to provide my medical history in their data system including who my physician was and other personal information. I was prepared to discuss relevant basics about my health so they could appropriately answer my questions but I definitely felt their ask for all my information even before a basic consult was an overreach. She tried to justify the ask by saying it was regulatory and then by saying it was for contract tracing. They already had my name and phone number, which is all any business has needed to contact tracing. The other (well regarded) place I went to for a consult did not demand all this data to answer a few simple questions. And no, this doesn't mean the other place was any less thorough, they asked plenty of questions about my health but didn't demand it be entered into their system first.

What if your next experience was even better?

What if it‚Äôs been a while and you noticed big changes?
Well, I‚Äôm editing my Clinique De Mode review  because the past few years haven‚Äôt been easy on businesses. So I‚Äôll review my latest experience.

With so many changes occurring at a rapid pace.
Some things have remained calm, relaxing and dependable. Clinique De Mode is one of them.
Being voted Toronto‚Äôs #1. Medical Spa, two years running‚Ä¶with Year Three on the way is well deserved!
A lot goes into receiving such an award and we are incredibly lucky to have one of their locations in Leslieville.

I‚Äôve reviewed Clinique De Mode before, yet I felt the need to give them some love again.
To me, one of the most important positions in any establishment is always your first point of contact. Whether it be via phone, email or face to face.

Client Care is of utmost importance. You want to feel cared about and welcomed, no matter what your visit is for.

Was the experience warm? Did you feel calm & unhurried?
Was the environment as hygienic feeling as we feel the need for right now? (It was just as hygienic pre-covid btw)

Do they offer fantastic products at attainable costs?
Not make you feel pressured into purchasing skincare products at the end of your visit
Are Skin Treatments being provided by technicians whom have attained the most up to date knowledge, certification and skills?!?

Are they able to provide ALL of this coupled with that warmth, professionalism and constancy we deserve as well? Is that possible?!??

The answer is yes. 100%!
Clinique De Mode has consistently provided all of this and more since my first experience there five years ago.

I‚Äôm not a monthly client. Yet my experience has always felt personal with my technician.
They always know what took place the last time I visited.
I‚Äôve never once felt ‚Äúless than‚Äù for not having the means to come in on a schedule (I would so love to one day!! üòä)

They provide specials every few months and unlike so many medical spa‚Äôs, their promotions are fresh and attainable.

Meaning I may have wanted to try this or that with my skincare regime.
I couldn‚Äôt commit to a package & here‚Äôs a promotion that will let me see some results if I try it.

Clinique De Mode is not a fast food chain. They are a caring, highly professional team that certainly don‚Äôt need to make a buck off of you.
They genuinely care about your skin, but also your experience. They‚Äôre a part of our community.
It‚Äôs a swanky li‚Äôl place! It‚Äôs a boutique but you could almost envision a cozy fireplace.

Here‚Äôs to another deserved ü•á

Clinique de Mode is fabulous all around. From the patient Care Coordinators to the Clinicians, everyone is extremely friendly, accommodating and welcoming.
They offer the most up to date services in the cleanliest environment, performed by highly qualified professionals.
They always go out of their way to accommodate you and they aren‚Äôt about making money off of you or up-selling you on products or services. They are extremely respectful and honest.
I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else for services anymore and highly recommend everyone gives them a try. You won‚Äôt be disappointed and you‚Äôll keep going back üòä",2,

Firstly, clinic co-owner Christina is beyond lovely. She genuienly cares about her clients, their goals and truly wants you to see results. She has always greeted me with a warm welcome and offers a coffee or water before treatment begins. I've never been made to feel rushed (which has happened to me at other clinics) and instead feel like I'm being invited into someone's home.

Second, the clinic itself is beautiful. You can tell the moment you walk in that a lot of care went into the design of the space. It's clean, full of natural light and is filled with top of the line skin care gadgets that I've never seen before. You really get the sense that you're getting the best of the best at Clinique De Mode.

Last, the facials at Clinique WORK. I have long battled with adult acne and have spent countless amounts of money on products, procedures, specialists etc. and nothing ever worked for me until I went for a hydrafacial at Clinique De Mode.
