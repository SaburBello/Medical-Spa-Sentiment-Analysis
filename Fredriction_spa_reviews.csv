I came to her with a vision for a vibrant color and some intricate braids, and she exceeded all my expectations.

As someone with naturally curly hair, I've struggled to find a stylist who truly understands my hair type and can work with it. Jaimie not only delivered a stunning result but also took the time to educate me on the best ways to care for and style my curls.
I left the salon feeling confident and beautiful, and I can't wait to return to Jaimie for my next hair transformation.

I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and knowledgeable stylist who will provide a truly exceptional experience.",,Wow! This absolutely made our day Shanelle!

I have had amazing pedicures at the school and half the price. Wouldn’t be so bad if you actually included a drink and some paraffin wax.

He is warm, friendly, and listens to what you’re wanting to have done. He is AMAZING at his skill with hair and on top of that has SUCH an awesome energy.

I was so lucky to get her when another hairdresser cancelled! Now I will see no one else and recommend her to everyone. She's done cuts and colours for me and my experience has been absolutely superb. She understands what I'm going for and is able to zero in on the most important aspects - for me that's a natural look. I might not get exactly what my pinterest board shows but I end up with something much better suited to me that ends up being perfect! She's the kind of hairdresser that can somehow make too-short bangs look longer, fix the residual orange from the time you made bad life choices and box-dyed, and will give you what you need first, and then what you want. She's also an absolute delight of a human being and wonderful to chat with - the time in the chair passes in the blink of an eye. Thanks Kara and I look forward to seeing you again!",,"Kathryn,

I enjoy the atmosphere -- the sountrack and vibe is more energetic, less Enya -- and Marzi was great. She gave me a recommendation that was different than what I'd booked based on the condition of my nails and what I'd stated as my needs. I'd just shed the last of my last shellac so my nails were flimsy and awful-looking, and I needed strong nails to be able to set up a tradeshow booth solo within the week after. The overlay was just what I needed, and I love the colour I picked. Though I'd dinged the side of my thumbnail in the LED light tray and we both missed it, and the shaping on 1 nail was a little uneven, overall it was a great experience! Maria was great with her service as well, and Mika bringing her sweet dog Bella in was the icing on the cake. Thanks, all! I'll be back :)",2,wow brenda! 🧡 thank you so much for the kind words! we're so glad you made it in before your trade show (+ so happy to see it went well! congrats!). we can't wait to have you back in bar soon to catch up 😊 …

The nail artist talked me out of a few ideas I came in with despite my persistence, and although I liked the nails I left with at first, unfortunately in the light of day the nail shapes were uneven and they didn’t appear to have cured properly so they were attracting dirt which made them look awful. I reshaped them and fixed them with my own UV gel top coat and lamp and I like them much better now. I would  recommend the Ten Spot, it is really nice in there, but I would advise against selecting white with the sparkly top coat because it didn’t seem to work as well for me.

After leaving last week very frustrated, they called us again apologized and offered us two free quickie pedis.I had Maddy and she continued to ask how we were feeling and how the service was. Making lots of conversations, suggesting different things to do to keep up with dry skin. The receptionist came up and had a chatted with us as well. This was a much better experience, thank you Maddy and Maria (I think that was her name). The Ten Spot definitely did everything they could to satisfy us.

Updating my review: went down to one star, was supposed to go in with my friend today and fix their mistakes but our appointment was booked wrong and we were apparently 10 minutes late. So they couldn’t give us the services
Only positive experience about going in again was how nice Maddy and Cara were.
The owner came in during my service and was super nice but the overall service I received was not great. I got the quickie pedi it says the service lasts 45 minutes and it was max half hour. I could choose a massage or taking the dead skin off my feet and I choose a massage but it was hardly even a massage. It lasted 2 minutes max. After our pedicures were done the ladies left us and never said anything to us. We just sat there, didn't give us an estimate time to sit and wait for our toes to dry just left without any words. Lastly, my friend came with me and her part of her nail has already peeled off.",4,"Hi Cassidy,

What a world of difference! I want to leave my original review, because people should be able to read it. But I wanted to change the rating because they did make it up to us. Today, we saw Marzi and Maddy (and the excellent receptionist, whose name is slipping my mind ~sorry! You were super nice, I just have a terrible memory!). They took great care of my friend and I. I’m very happy with my service. 4 stars only because of all of the inconvenience of the first 2 problematic visits.

EDIT: I’d give 0 stars if I could… we were asked to give them a second chance to right the wrongs. We booked and then something came up at work and I had to rebook. They sent us Thursday (today) at 4:45 -and I have the email to confirm this. There was some unexpected traffic because of a car accident on the bridge so it was 4:49 as we were parking. The salon called us and told us they were unable to do our service because we were 10 minutes into our allotted time. We explained that it was 4 minutes late and they said they would call us back. We were already parked so we went inside. Turns out the owner booked us for 4:40 but told me 4:45. So we were 10 minutes behind scheduled time. This salon apparently leaves no buffer time between appointments so they couldn’t do anything for us both. We could choose to have 1 person quickly fixed; but not both. So apparently my friend is supposed to just sit there unhappy while I get it fixed; or vice verse. We ended up leaving. What a waste of time and gas money. I’ve never been more disappointed with a salon in my life. Staff today were kind, but honestly that didn’t help me at all. Such a let down. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND! After not having our nails fixed today they offered us 10% off our next appointment- NO THANKS.

I was unhappy with my service last week. My friend and I went in for quickie pedis and we were not happy with the service or the results. I posted a longer, more detailed review, but it seems that review keeps getting removed. In short, we felt like the service was rushed. The quality of my pedi was sub-par. My nails are poorly cut, the polish is clunky-looking, and it chipped not even 12 hours after I got it done. Overall, not too pleased with the service.",2,"Hi Emily,

Jolene did my hair trial and my wedding hair and she too went above and beyond to make sure the style was not only something I loved, but something that would last all day/night (she nailed it!) and Megan Wood did my mani/pedi and waxing.

I did my first hair colour on 2020. Which was really nice and this year last month I did another hair colouring. I ask for the exact same hair colour and styling. But they did an entirely different colour and styling on my hair. I am getting married on this December and I mentioned all this things before my hair colouring. And the difficult part is I am in Moncton now and I drove all the over to Fredericton just for my hair colouring. After the styling I contact the store and mentioned my concern. They offer me a hair redo. Before I am doing my second hair colouring last month I had a natural black hair colour. At the redo time I again show them my reference pictures and request for an exact same result. But, she put full black hair colour in my head which was my natural hair colour. I ask her to put highlights and all. But she didn’t do anything visible in my head and even she ask me to sign on a consent form. I signed that and in the consent form she wrote that she will put few highlights. But there is no highlights or not even any other colour. They just put a complete black hair colour which was my natural hair colour before I do the colouring. I’m vere disappointed by there response. I contacted the store again and show them before and after pictures and they agree that I am right.I also mentioned that there is no point of paying for my natural hair colour.But they are not ready to give my money back just because I signed on there consent. Even in the consent form they can see my request about adding highlights. Here I will add few pictures. 1st pictures taken from the store in 2020 and that was my first hair colouring and also my reference to the second hair colouring which I did  last month. 2nd picture was taken in last month ( which is my worst hair colouring ) and 3 rd pictures was my hair redo (which is also a reference from my first hair colouring for there store)",2,Hello Maria!

I had a pedicure which was $78 and I came home to see my heels were still so dry and nail polish outside of my toenails- which wouldn’t be so bad if I had paid $35, but for $78 quality has to be top notch. It looks like the bottom of my feet weren’t even done. It has made shopping around much easier when prices are so high and quality is so low.",3,"Heather,

The girl that did my nails didn't even know how to properly take off nail polish, she botched my nails so badly and I got so tired of asking her to fix things that I just gave up because I wanted to leave. We had been there for almost 5 hours already at that point. When it came down to pay, I explained to the manager about my terrible nail job and she said she would credit my account for another mani/pedi. I was also told I could use this at another location. I called for mother's day weekend trying to book and they were booked pretty solid (understandable) however, they tried telling me at the downtown location that they could squeeze me in but it wouldn't be for the full amount of time it's supposed to take (they would rush it) Seriously? Cause that's what I paid for? A rushed job? At this point I gave up on ever using my credit up until today. My husband convinced me that I deserved it and should use the credit I had sitting there, so I called and booked for this weekend. I called the uptown location first (where I originally had gone) I asked the girl if I could pay the difference for gel nail polish on my hands and she said it was fine but that it would cost $24. I thought she was nuts, who charges $24 for applying gel nail polish to finger nails????????? I said nope, not interested. I looked on their website and it clearly stated there that the extra fee is $12 NOT $24. So I called back, asked to speak with a manager (it was the same girl that had answered) and the manager wasn't around. So I said to her, the polish is $12 extra and not $24. I then asked if I could book for downtown cause at this point I didn't want to deal with uptown anymore. I spoke with the lady there, she booked me in and I guess we'll see how it goes on Saturday. But regardless of the outcome, I will NEVER be going to Avalon ever again. Not like I'm sure they even care..

***UPDATE***
Since I have written the review, Crystal from the uptown location has reached out and apologized for the lack of customer service I had received and urged that this was not the way they believe their customers should be treated. She has been nice enough to reach out and make things better. I do plan on going back with a perfect pair service (massage and facial) with my mother in law at the downtown location next week and I'm actually looking forward to it. Thank you for reaching out and making things better, Crystal. :)",3,"Rachel,

The lady who did the procedure was very polite and asked questions before doing something.
But I did not like that we were with other clients. When they were done a whole conversation was going on when they were done and a whole conversation with a new client. So having a relaxing quiet pedicure was a NO.
The 4 lights above our heads, 1 shined right down in my face and made it uncomfortable to open my eyes. I would have to turn my head to the right or left.
If was bright in the room. I wish it would have been darker in the area so we could of relaxed. Instead we are beside a window by a walkway and you could see people and vehicles.
Last but not least my heals and feet still have lots of roughness taken off.
It was very disappointing.",,"Wendy,

I have been getting my underarms and Brazilian done here for quiet a while. I have done 8/9 sessions and have really great results! I would say (92 out of 100%) removed.

Anna is amazing she is super understanding and comfortable to deal with! I would say based on your hair colour it depends on how many sessions you need! Some other people may need 6, where I felt comfortable with 9 sessions. ☺️

I am naturally blonde but have a light brownish and some blonde hair areas. Get the consultation if you are curious, I was not certain at first about the light brown would work. No more razor burn, or painful sensitive spots. I’m very fair skinned and found this got rid of any concerns I had with my sensitive skin! 💜

Thank you again Anna ☺️",1,

Erin has done my hair numerous times and it astounds me just how precise and meticulous she is each time.

She is clearly very experienced and well educated in the field as she knows just how much time is sufficient for each step, she knows exactly the colors to choose that will complement your coloring, and she is a perfectionist who will go the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your hair.  She is honest and will tell you what you can realistically accomplish in one session when comparing your hair with your ""hair inspiration"" photo.  So in the end, you know exactly what you will get.

Her work is gorgeous, flawless and perfect.  I've never had a hair stylist so astute.  She really should be charging a lot more for the quality of service that she provides.  I've been living in Europe for the past year and no matter how much money I pay, nor how many hair stylists I visit, I am always finding the results lackluster in comparison with Erin's touch. ❤❤ Miss your beautiful work Erin!!😭❤",1,thanks lots!

The massage was terrible as she was literally spreading oil/cream on my body just like marinating meat! No pressure at all! I asked her to increase pressure a bit but she responded stating that was her limit beyond which her fingers would break and this was supposed to be a relaxation massage and not deep tissue. I very well knew I can't expect RMT standards so had kept my expectations low but this was way below that. Utter waste of time and money.

The girl I spoke with on the phone seemed ""annoyed"", she didn't really offer any information. She told me there was a fee for the consultation and that they were booking into June.  Then she said I could take a picture and send an email and they would reply to me with what needed to be done and set an appointment for treatment. I'm sorry, but when it comes to stuff like acne and scarring, I think that this should be seen in person and not just in a photo. I'm also not going to go for treatment for this issue without having any knowledge about it either. I just feel like this was really unprofessional and I'm really frustrated.

Isla is a rockstar and any salon in Fredericton  would be so lucky to hire her when she graduates! She listened so well and gave me exactly what I wanted! My hair is extremely thick and few hairstylists have taken the time to make sure I have an even hair cut. She worked methodically layer by layer through my hair. She then styled my hair with curls as a bonus which was such a pick-me-up. Thank you!!!,,

I found the staff to be understanding, and very accomadating. The only people who had issues where those who were lacking in attendance and were probably not meant to do it in the first place. I am very successful in my new career and i owe it  all to Majestany and Their staff.
I would recommend this school to anyone who wanted to advance themselves in the Hair or Aesthetic Industry.",,
